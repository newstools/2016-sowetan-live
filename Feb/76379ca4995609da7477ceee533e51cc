Ground handling staff at Harare International Airport on Sunday discovered the body of a man stashed in the stowaway of a United States cargo plane. African News Agency could not immediately verify where the six crew-member plane, registration N545JN, was coming from or was destined, but informed sources said it had come from Munich, Germany, and was bound for Durban, South Africa. The plane stopped at Harare International Airport to refuel and ground handling staff noticed blood dripping from the aircraft air conditioning vault. “The jet crew was questioned and they said they hit a bird in the air. But then a search was made and the body of an adult male fell out,” a source told ANA. The crew was reportedly arrested. Officials from the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe could not immediately comment. Police spokesperson senior assistant commissioner Charity Charamba confirmed the case and said police were investigating the matter. – African News Agency (ANA)
