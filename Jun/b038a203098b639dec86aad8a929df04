Bloemfontein Celtic are looking at Collins Mbesuma as a possible solution for their poor scoring form of last season club officials said on Tuesday.The top goal scorer in the Premier Soccer League last season is a free agent after his contract with Mpumalanga Black Aces was not renewed despite a haul of 14 goals which won him the Golden Boot award for the second time.Celtic s quick counterattack style last season set up a myriad of chances but the side were wasteful and ended the season with a tally of just 30 league goals an average of just one goal per game.Five goals came in one match alone against Ajax Cape Town towards the end of the season as Celtic snapped a horror run that saw them go from early season contenders to potential relegation candidates.Coach Serame Letsoaka spent much of the season complaining about missed opportunities and Mbesuma is seen as a possible solution to that dilemma although a decision on signing him is still to be taken.The 32-year-old Zambia international has scored a total of 97 league and cup goals in exactly 200 starts since he first played in the PSL more than a decade ago after joining Kaizer Chiefs.He went to England Turkey and Portugal before returning to the PSL in 2008 at Mamelodi Sundowns and has since been on the books of Moroka Swallows Lamontville Golden Arrows Orlando Pirates and for the last two season at Aces.
