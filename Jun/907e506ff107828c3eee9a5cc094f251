Former Kaizer Chiefs striker Mark Williams says only one player in the current AmaKhosi squad covered himself with glory last season and the rest should not have been allowed to come near the club s famous gold and black shirt.The outspoken Williams was critical of a side that could only manage a fifth-place finish and said only midfielder William Twala understood the weight of expectation that comes with pulling on the club s jersey. Twala was the only player in the whole team who played like he understood the tradition of the Kaizer Chiefs jersey Williams said without mincing his words.The 26 year-old winger only joined Chiefs in January and it speaks volumes that Williams believes he was still better than players who played from the start of the season 10 months ago.Chiefs announced a massive clear out of players this week in a dramatic move that raised eyebrows and took many fans by surprise.But Williams said the decision was a long time coming after the disappointing season Chiefs had. The club had to do that if they are to compete with (league champions) Mamelodi Sundowns next season. Some of the players they are releasing were not really quality. That is the truth. We are talking a bout a big team here. Williams who played for Chiefs between 1996 and 1997 said all eyes are on Chiefs and what they do next will be very crucial. What they are going to buy is going to be very interesting. The question is are they going to buy quality? The club is expected to announce new signings at the end of June.
