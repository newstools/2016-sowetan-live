Former Hard Livings gang leader Rashied Staggie is hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop charges of possession of stolen property against him. Staggie was arrested in April alongside Johannesburg businessman Jayaray Pillay‚ Pillay’s son Mikyle‚ and Joao de Gouveia. They were found in possession of 23 bottles of Johnnie Walker Green Label whisky worth about R20 000 in April. Staggie believes the state’s case against him is weak. He and his co-accused appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Attorney Rooshdeen Rudolph‚ for Staggie‚ Pillay and Mikyle‚ told the court that he required the police docket in order to prepare representation to the director of public prosecution. The court postponed the matter to November 18. Their bail was also extended. Outside court‚ Rudolph said the state’s case was weak. “What is wrong with having whisky in your cars?” asked Rudolph? “They paid for it.” Police pounced on the four in their luxury cars near Canal Walk shopping centre in April. Liquor‚ Cuban cigars and cigarettes were in their possession. At the time‚ police said the whisky was part of a batch worth more than R10 million stolen from a depot. Staggie has been on parole since 2014 after serving 13 years in jail. He was sentenced to 15 years for kidnapping and rape in 2003‚ and the following year he was sentenced to a further 15 years for stealing firearms from a police armoury. The sentences ran concurrently. The Department of Correctional Services did not revoke his parole Pillay is a businessman from Kempton Park‚ on the East Rand. He said he was convicted of culpable homicide in 1981 and was given a five-year suspended sentence. Meanwhile‚ Staggie told the court during his bail application that he had a wife‚ four dependents and earned a R5000 salary as a motivational speaker. The four are out on R5000 bail each. — TMG Digital
