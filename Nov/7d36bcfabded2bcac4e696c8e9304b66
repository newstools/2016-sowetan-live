Premier Soccer League chairman Irvin Khoza is set to assume another four-year term in office when the football governing body hold its elective conference in Johannesburg today.Khoza, 68, will run unopposed, with the jostle for positions only left to the 14 candidates who will contest for the seven available berths to serve in the National Soccer League's (NSL) executive committee.The NSL conducts its affairs under the PSL banner.Those vying for the executive committee positions are Kaizer Motaung (Kaizer Chiefs), Mato Madlala (Golden Arrows); John Comitis (Cape Town City); Stanley Matthews (SuperSport Utd); Dan Simelane, Rejoice Simelane (both Mamelodi Sundowns); David Thidiela (Black Leopards); Jose Ferreira (Bidvest Wits); Goolam Allie (Santos); Khurishi Mphahlele (Baroka); Khumbulani Konco (Bloemfontein Celtic); Larry Brookstone (Highlands Park); Ari Efstathiou (Ajax Cape Town); Sibusiso Mpisane (Royal Eagles).Thidiela, Mpisane and Allie are the only club bosses from the NFD who have been seconded in the list that is dominated by their counterparts from the elite league. A chairman and seven-member executive committee will get the nod from the 32 member clubs - PSL (10 votes each) and NFD (two votes) - by secret ballot.The chief executive officer completes the structure but they are not voted for at the quadrennial meeting.Madlala is the acting CEO since her appointment a year ago."The meeting will discuss the normal business of the league and the number of other issues that covers the corporatisation of the league, but the chairman will expand on that," said PSL spokesman Lux September yesterday, adding that the financials in the year under review will also be tabled.The league received an unqualified audit report for the year ended July 31 last year, where they made in excess of R60-million in profit. Khoza has been credited within the local football fraternity for turning around the PSL from an organisation previously heavily in debt to one that now consistently reports a healthy profit.The PSL enjoyed an increase in revenue - from R670-million to R725-million - owing to the annual increase in the existing sponsorship and broadcast agreements, according to the 2014/15 financial statement.Who votes?PSL and NFD clubs;One delegate mandated by their clubs and;Each member of the executive committee (one vote) save in respect of the election of the executive committee where they will not vote in their capacity as members.
