The son of former SABC board member and journalist Hope Zinde has been arrested for allegedly attacking his father with a glass and strangling him.Mark Warona Zinde, who was released on R10000 bail on September 20 for allegedly killing Zinde, 50, was sent back to prison last week following the assault of Lebohang Mohale Manoto on November 6.Manoto was reading a newspaper at his home in Walkerville, south Johannesburg, when the incident allegedly took place.He was rescued by his wife while Warona was allegedly choking him.Manoto later laid charges against his son at the De Deur police station.Warona is facing a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.He attracted media scrutiny earlier this year after he was accused of murdering his mother on June 6 at her home in Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort, North West.Zinde was missing for several days before her body was found stuffed in the boot of a car in her garage.After yesterday's court proceedings, Manoto refused to speak to Sowetan, saying the matter was now in the hands of the court and everything will be heard in court.Hardly two months after his release on bail, Warona yesterday made a second appearance in the Vereeniging Magistrate's Court.He was wearing a blue T-shirt, blue checked shorts and sandals.He walked from the holding cells with a limp as his legs were shackled.Warona told magistrate AD Noble his lawyer was not present in court even though he had promised during his first appearance last week he would bring one.Manoto, who had a plaster on his face beneath his glasses, told the court Warona was his son and didn't know what arrangements had been made by Warona's relatives in Pretoria regarding his legal representation."Mark has another matter (in Brits) where he has an attorney. I don't know if the attorney will avail himself (for this matter)," Manoto said."We will have to come to court and report what has been decided by the family."He has a right to appoint a lawyer from Legal Aid Board at this point."Warona then asked for Legal Aid to represent him.Noble adjourned the matter for the investigating officer to come to court and verify if Warona has an alternative address because his father was no longer willing to accommodate him at his house should he be granted bail.Warona said he has an alternative address in Mamelodi, but didn't know the house address and only knew directions to go there.During his previous bail application in the Brits Magistrate's Court, prosecutor Hanna Conradie argued Warona should not be granted bail because he would undermine and jeopardise the objectives of the criminal system and bail conditions.However, Magistrate Moses Maswanganyi granted him bail and said there was no evidence Warona would endanger the lives of those around him or commit further offences.He was staying with his father in Walkerville as part of his bail conditions and was ordered to report daily to the De Deur police station.Mark is scheduled to appear in the Brits Magistrate's Court on November 22. Hope Zinde's mother has extended an olive branch to her grandson Warona after he allegedly assaulted his father two Sundays ago.Mark Warona Zinde's grandmother Audrey Zinde said the family was willing to assist him in finding him a rehabilitation centre.She said her grandson's drug habit could have affected his mind.She said if Mark could be granted bail by the court, the family would meet later and discuss where he would be accommodated.However, she has promised that they will attend his next court appearance.
