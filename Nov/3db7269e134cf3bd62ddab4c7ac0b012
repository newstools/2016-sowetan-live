Motivation and living up to his dream pushed a Gauteng-based businessman to find the means to put bread on the table as his own boss.Manuel Ovana, 52, started his company, Cool House Engineering, after spending many years working in the cooling and engineering industry.Ovana's company specialises in cooling systems, refrigeration and commercial, industrial and domestic conditioning.In 1999 he formed his company and started operating alone.The company is now spreading its wings across the country."It was difficult at the time. Customers were not as many as they are now, [But] I told myself on that day that I would be my own boss and today am living my dream," he saidThe married father of 12 children currently employs 22 people. Ovana said when he started his company he relied on people who worked on a part-time basis."Money was not coming in. I had to ask a few boys to lend me a hand and I would pay them as soon as customers had paid."Suddenly, the company started growing and then I began employing more people," Ovana said.His company used to rely mainly on government jobs but has now also secured a few contracts with big companies in the private sector.Ovana moved from one office space to another like a lioness leading its cubs, especially when the company started to grow.However, he is currently settled at the Steeledale industrial park in Johannesburg.He said one of his biggest challenges were customers failing to pay on time."It is difficult to run a company without cash. When customers don't pay on time it is a "crisis", it feels like a sword being pushed in your body. Another challenge is our banking system."It is hard to secure a loan from a bank when customers are failing to pay on time. That is the time when I need to pay my employees and settle other matters that keep the company floating."Banks demand many documentation before they could offer [you] a loan and they sometimes advise us to go to loan sharks, which is a route I will never take."He said he is happy though that his company is changing many lives, especially his employees'."Apart from providing services, I pay salaries. Those salaries bring smiles to many faces. My employees are breadwinners. If I don't pay them, then it means many people are going to bed on empty stomachs."He advised other small companies to offer opportunities to emerging companies."At times it is difficult for us small companies to help one another because we are often too hungry."But if we can change that mentality then industries will grow and many people will secure employment to fight unemployment and poverty," he said.ntwagaes@sowetan.co.za
