Banyana Banyana will have to contend with a hostile atmosphere in today s CAF Women s Africa Cup of Nations clash against Cameroon but interim head coach Desiree Ellis is not fazed.The Indomitable Lionesses will host Banyana at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in a Group A match and with Banyana having drawn their first match against Zimbabwe they desperately need to win to keep their hopes of reaching the knockout phase alive.Cameroon though will prove too difficult to beat in their own backyard after getting off to a good start by beating Egypt 2-0 in the opening match.Ellis however told TMG Digital that it is not exactly mission impossible in terms of Banyana s chances in today s match (5pm SA time). Look when you are playing the host country you are sort of the underdogs."They ve got the 12th man but in another way that could also count against them."We know what pressure is like playing at home and the first 20 minutes could maybe not go their way."The crowd can turn against them and we have to sort of get the crowd on our side Ellis stated.Banyana will have to be clinical if they are to win against the hosts. Their finishing against Zimbabwe was poor to say the least but the former Banyana captain remains confident. We have played them a few times."They have pretty good players in Europe including African Women Footballer of the Year Ga lle Deborah Enganamouit."So we know a lot about them but similarly they also know a lot about us."Hopefully we can cross the t's and dot the i's and deliver a performance that we know we are capable of she said.The 53-year-old is confident the defence can hold against the likes of Enganamouit because in her view that s probably one of Banyana s strengths. I thought our defence was magnificent against Zimbabwe which is one of our strengths and now we need to see how we can support more upfront as well Ellis added.In head-to-head statistics there is very little to separate the two sides but Banyana have the edge.The two sides have met on 14 previous occasions with Banyana winning six while Cameroon have won five.There have been three draws.Cameroon are ranked third in Africa (47th in the world) while Banyana are one spot below in fourth and 48th in world football.Forward Jermaine Seoposenwe is expected to start against Cameroon after coming off the bench against Zimbabwe.Seoposenwe joined the squad late from the United States of America because of study and club commitments at Samford University.The Women s Africa Cup of Nations doesn t fall under the FIFA calendar hence Seoposenwe and Holland-based goalkeeper Roxanne Barker were released late by their clubs.Speaking of Barker she is expected to settle for the bench after Andile Dlamini delivered a good performance in goal against Zimbabwe. - TMG Digital
