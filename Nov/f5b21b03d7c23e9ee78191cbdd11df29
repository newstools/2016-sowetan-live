Christmas is just around the corner and those who will be exploring South Africa might be hiring cars.If you will be hiring a vehicle, find out what are your rights and duties to avoid surprises when bringing it back to the rental agency.You may be held liable for damages you didn't cause to the car.Make sure you also keep your proof of payment for the usage of the car for at least three years, as the rental company may later claim you did not pay them.Mpho Liphapang, 42, of Spruitview on the East Rand was shocked two weeks ago when she was billed R40000 for the damage she allegedly caused to a car she rented two years ago while exploring the wonders of Namibia.She was also told she did not pay for usage of the car and is expected to prove she did.The mother of one said nobody told her that 80% of Namibia's roads were not tarred or that she needed a car suitable for gravel roads and rocks until this Monday when she met Avis officials."I was only told their car was insured and would be expected to pay an excess amount should I cause an accident while driving their car, and nothing was said about liability due to mechanical problems or its failure to perform," Liphapang said.Liphapang said she rented an Avis car for four days in August 2014. She flew to Windhoek airport where she collected the car before driving to Walvis Bay for her holiday with her family.She said everything went well until the last day when she and her family were driving back to Windhoek airport.The car got stuck on the way and they were stranded for six hours before Avis could send them a rescue car, she said.Liphapang said they decided to change their route to the airport to explore Namibia a little more.As they were driving, the car suddenly lost power and could not climb a steep hill. They were forced to pull over on the side of the road."Calling Avis in SA was a challenge as the network was just not good for our South African cellphones and we eventually got help from other local road users."When help finally arrived they had already missed their flight back home and had to find an alternative place to sleep, she said.This extra night and penalty fee at the airport was not budgeted for, and was never refunded after she tried to claim it back from Avis."Actually, a demand of this extra expenditure sparked the problem," she said.Avis then told her to pay R37000 for repairs as she had damaged the undercarriage of the car.She said Avis did not respond to her e-mail when she sought an explanation... until recently when she received a text message from Credit Works.Credit Works told her she had an accident while using an Avis car in 2014 and that she must make an arrangement on how she intended to repay the debt.Rebone Motsatsi, of Avis, said they were willing to resolve Liphapang's complaint amicably although they were of the view that Liphapang damaged their car.He said Avis's view was that she drove the car on unsuitable terrain .Motsatsi said driving the car on a gravel road with stones and rocks caused extreme undercarriage damage to the vehicle.Motsasti said Liphapang was liable. They would be investigating why she was billed R40000 when the actual damage was estimated at R19000, Motsatsi said.Motsatsi also said Liphapang had not paid for the usage of the car, but it later transpired that Avis omitted to debit her credit card although she authorised them to do so and there was money in her account.
