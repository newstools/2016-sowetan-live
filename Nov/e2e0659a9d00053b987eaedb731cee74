Hobart - South Africa hurtled to a series victory over Australia on the fourth day of the second Test at Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Tuesday.Kyle Abbott took 6/77 and Kagiso Rabada claimed 4/34 to dismiss the home side for 161 and wrap up the win by an innings and 80 runs more than 30 minutes before the scheduled lunch interval.The fact that all but two of the wickets that fell on Tuesday were effected by catches in the arc behind the wicket indicates how well Abbott and Rabada bowled on a responsive pitch.South Africa won the first Test at the WACA by 177 runs and Tuesday s triumph makes them only the second team to complete a hat-trick of series wins in Australia.The only other members of that club are West Indies who reeled off three series wins between 1984 and 1992.Graeme Smith led South Africa to victory Down Under in 2008-09 and 2012-13Australia resumed on 121/2 on Tuesday and lost their remaining eight wickets for 32 runs in 116 balls.Abbott struck the first blow with the day s 30th delivery which Usman Khawaja flashed at and edged to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.Khawaja held the South Africans at bay for more than two-and-a-half hours for his 64 and his dismissal ended a stand of 50 scored with Steve Smith that endured for 18 overs.Smith s wicket was the other key to unlocking success for South Africa and he was eighth out when Rabada had him caught behind for 31. - TMG Sport
