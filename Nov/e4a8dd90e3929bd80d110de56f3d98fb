A group of people have been arrested in connection with the torching of three houses in GaMphethi village near Burgersfort in Limpopo.The eight are today expected to appear before the Mecklenburg Magistrate's Court as the police clamp down on the people suspected to have perpetrated an attack that resulted in the death of a four-year-old boy.Sowetan yesterday reported that the community members contributed R10 each to hire a sangoma to assist in resolving the mystery behind the death of Revenge Mphethi who was found in the area at the weekend.The homes of three people, including Wilson Mphethi, 64, and his bedridden younger brother Sello Mphethi, 60, were apparently targeted after the consultation with a sangoma implicated them in the child's death.Provincial spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said eight suspects aged between 20 and 46 were arrested. He said more arrests were expected soon.Ngoepe said the eight were charged with arson and malicious damage to property. He said an inquest docket had been opened relating to the death of the four-year-old boy."The cause of death is still unknown but the post-mortem will tell," Ngoepe said.He added the decision to arrest the traditional healer would be determined by the findings of the ongoing investigations.Sello's wife Pauline Mphethi, 55, yesterday welcomed the arrests, saying she hoped justice would be served. She and her husband left the area protected by police.When their home was attacked on Sunday Sello who is unable to walk due to illness was carried out of the house by his daughter Joyce and another relative."I don't think I will return to GaMphethi after what happened. My heart is filled with sadness every time I think about that place. They destroyed my property because they say I'm a witch. Who have I bewitched?" Pauline asked.mahopoz@sowetan.co.za
