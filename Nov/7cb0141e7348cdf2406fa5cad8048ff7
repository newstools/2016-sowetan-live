PSL chairman Irvin Khoza says it is high time the league introduces new blood to move towards a succession plan.Khoza, 68, said this shortly after he was re-elected unopposed at the league's quadrennial general meeting yesterday where three new faces were voted into the executive committee.The trio of Khumbulani Konco (Bloemfontein Celtic), Rejoice Simelane (Mamelodi Sundowns) and Jose Ferreira (Bidvest Wits) made the seven-member committee following the elective conference in Monte Casino, Johannesburg, yesterday.They replaced John Comitis (Cape Town City), Dan Simelane (Sundowns) and Mike Mokoena (Free State Stars).Khoza said the newcomers will help the league build for the future considering that some in the executive like him and Kaizer Motaung, 72, were not young anymore. Therefore, it is time for new blood."It is a question of dealing with succession to say, 'how do we deal with the issues of passing over the experience', because most of us are on our way out sooner than later," said Khoza yesterday."What we did in our last elections, we took most of them into our sub-committees; Jessica Motaung (Chiefs), Rantsi Mokoena (FS Stars), Nkosana Khoza, Floyd Mbele (both Pirates) for them to be ingratiated as to how the workings of the PSL take place so by the time you come into the executive committee, you have an idea," said the Pirates boss.Khoza further touched briefly on how the newcomers were expected to contribute and said they bring in "rare expertise" to the league."Sis Rejoice (Simelane) is an economist by training and if there is one thing that's been missing in our distribution of content, we've never discussed the business side of football."I think because of her uniqueness in terms of qualifications, I'm going to make it her responsibility to be a commentator on the economic impact of football," Khoza explained."Jose (Ferreira) is going to be handling issues, for instance, on the statutes because he was in the legal and constitutional community as a sub-committee member. So now he's going to be the one faced with that kind of responsibility."Khumbulani is what we call, in our speak, the IT generation. He's coming in with those skills and he is one of the youth league as we call them in the PSL," he said.With regards to the position of PSL chief executive - which has been occupied by Golden Arrows chairwoman Mato Madlala for a year now - Khoza suggested that finding a permanent chief executive is easier said than done.As it stands, Madlala will continue in the position and since she's been in the system for a long time, Khoza claimed the league is benefitting hugely from her experience.Meanwhile, the PSL posted a profit of R15-million for the financial year ending July 31.
