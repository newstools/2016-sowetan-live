Springbok coach Allister Coetzee chose a team with a view to Rugby World Cup 2019 when he named his last squad of 2016 to face Wales.The under-fire coach picked three uncapped players in the starting line-up - wing Jamba Ulengo, centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg and flank Uzair Cassiem - with a fourth, loose forward Jean-Luc du Plessis on the bench. Cassiem replaces the injured Willem Alberts, who is struggling with a neck injury.If all four uncapped players make it on to the Principality Stadium pitch tomorrow, it would take the number of new caps Coetzee has awarded in 2016 to 12.Coetzee has jettisoned 124-cap veteran Bryan Habana, 41-cap stalwart Willie le Roux and relegated 55-cap fly-half Pat Lambie to the bench.It's a clear message that he is looking to the future and breaking from the past. Whether such a callow team has the ability to end a rot that has seen the Boks lose six of their last seven Tests, including a chastening 20-18 defeat against Italy last week, is questionable.But nothing has worked so far on tour, so a new direction is the only way left for Coetzee to go.Coetzee's job hangs by a thread, if at all, but the coach is determined to go out on his terms if it is to be his last Test in charge.Ulengo brings raw pace and the ability to finish while Van Rensburg's sheer power and ability to drive over the advantage line are exciting prospects.Cassiem is a great ball carrier with a tireless engine who could be at the start of a prosperous Test career. Coetzee has also reverted to Faf de Klerk and Elton Jantjies at halfback with Rudy Paige dropping out of the 23 altogether and Piet van Zyl coming in as replacement halfback. - TMG Sport
