Stomers flank Nizaam Carr will make his run-on debut for the Springboks when they take on Italy at the Artemio Franchi Stadium tomorrow (3pm).Carr is one of two changes to the starting line-up from the side that lost 37-21 to England at Twickenham last week, which also sees Bryan Habana returning in place of JP Pietersen.With lock Eben Etzebeth ruled out of the match due to concussion, Pieter-Steph du Toit returns to the second row after playing flank a week ago.Carr will form a new back row with Willem Alberts moving to blindside flank after operating at openside last week and Warren Whiteley retaining his place at No 8. In all, there are five changes to the 23-man squad.The bench shows three changes with prop Trevor Nyakane, flank Teboho Mohoje and flyhalf Elton Jantjies taking the places of Lourens Adriaanse, Carr and Lionel Mapoe respectively."We've got to win the race to the ball this week. Italy go hard with low tackles and the next man in over the ball, so we hope Nemo [Carr] does well," coach Allister Coetzee said."Continuity is key and although we are not getting the results, there is progress. We have kept the same combinations in an effort to continue building combinations at centre and halfback in particular. The changes on the bench are necessary because we need rotation and also to bring some impact."
