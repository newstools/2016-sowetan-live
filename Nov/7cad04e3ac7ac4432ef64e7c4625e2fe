Another police commissioner could be found to be on the wrong side of the law, as the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) probes acting police chief General Khomotso Phahlane for defeating the ends of justice.Yesterday it emerged that Phahlane was being investigated in connection with the construction of his home, allegedly worth R8-million in an up-market estate in Pretoria.It was alleged that Phahlane had contacted witnesses interviewed during the probe. The Ipid yesterday would not confirm or deny that he was being investigated."We are not in a position to comment at this stage without jeopardising our investigation," Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said.It was also alleged that the investigator in the matter had received death threats. One of the messages, seen by Sowetan, warns the investigator of working with private investigator Paul O'Sullivan."We are aware that you are working for a big foreign spy, Paul O'Sullivan, who is funded by his masters. This man is in cahoots with [head of Ipid] Robert [McBride]," the message reads."We know where you stay and your family. you must either choose to die with him [O'Sullivan]. We are watching boy."We are about to finish Paul. We have everything on hi."O'Sullivan yesterday said he had opened a docket against Phahlane in January after a colonel in the police had come to him with information about the house in Pretoria.He said he had spent three to four months investigating and found there was prima facie evidence against the acting national commissioner.O'Sullivan confirmed that he had received a copy of the death threat sent to the investigator. He said he had laid another complaint against Phahlane for intimidation, as the acting commissioner was the only other person who knew he had approached the Ipid.Phahlane's office welcomed any investigation on any allegations and matter against him conducted within the confines of the law.A number of leaders of different state institutions appear to be in trouble with the law. President Jacob Zuma recently wrote a letter to NPA boss Shaun Abrahams asking him to justify why he should not be suspended.At the time a heated exchange of letters between Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza and Abrahams surfaced, with Ntlemeza demanding to know why the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were dropped.Johan Burger of the Institute of Security Studies said allegations against Phahlane raised concerns given what happened to the three previous police commissioners."He has been performing well and this will make people to be worried and it paints a dull picture of instability and dishonesty within the police."All former police commissioners after 1994, except George Fivaz, have left the position under a cloud.He was succeeded by the now late Jackie Selebi who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2010.Bheki Cele took over but left in 2012 after a three-person board of inquiry unanimously recommended that Cele be fired.Riah Phiyega succeeded him but is on suspension. Phahlane was appointed acting commissioner.
