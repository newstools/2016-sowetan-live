Orlando Pirates stand-in coach Augusto Palacios has explained the absence of goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo in their 1-0 victory over a struggling but resilient Free State Stars at Orlando Stadium on Saturday evening.Jackson Mabokgwane started his first match of the season in place of regular keeper Mhlongo who did not even make the bench. Brighton arrived from Mozambique very sick from diarrhoea the Pirates interim coach told the media after the match. That s the reason Brighton is not here in the team today. The 25-year-old keeper seems to have picked up the illness in Maputo where Bafana Bafana drew 1-1 in an international friendly against Mozambique on Tuesday night. The doctor visited him and gave him some medication and he is still in bed said Palacios.The Pirates caretaker coach said Thamsanqa Gabuza also had a running stomach ahead of the match but managed to shake it off in time to make the squad.
