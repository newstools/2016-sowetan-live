About a season and a half into his job as Kaizer Chiefs coach, Steve Komphela has not been able to find a consistent starting line-up or a system he wants to play.Komphela has repeated the same starting line-up only once this season, in the back-to-back Absa Premiership victories over Maritzburg United and Free State Stars.After the 1-1 draw with SuperSport United at FNB Stadium on Wednesday, Komphela admitted that the constant change in line-ups and formation is usually influenced by inconsistent results or performances, while injuries and suspensions play a role too.The coach made changes to his line-up for the SuperSport game - after Chiefs' 2-1 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday. He brought back George Lebese, who cancelled out Thabo Mnyamane's opening goal."If you look at teams that do well, they are consistent with selection and they are also consistent with performance. And if your performance is not as consistent, then it does affect your selection and a whole lot of other factors," said Komphela after the draw, their fourth this season."If we look back at the Free State Stars [Telkom Knockout quarterfinal] match, it would be rare for us to make any changes because there was some momentum and consistency in results and performance, so you ride on that. But as soon as it does not come through, then you are looking for other options."Chiefs' winless streak was extended to five matches in all competitions with that draw at home, but they are only four points behind leaders Bidvest Wits. They have to start turning their draws and defeats into victories, if they want to keep up at the top."A draw is not good enough. You just have to keep winning."There's still a lot to be done and we can't lose focus. We have to move on and solve the problems."Komphela took off Lebese in the second half, much to the dismay of Chiefs supporters who thought the player was doing well."We were looking for fresh legs and when supporters say 'why do you take out the player?' It's because they love the player. But a decision had to be taken."Chiefs host Cape Town City at FNB Stadium on Tuesday.
