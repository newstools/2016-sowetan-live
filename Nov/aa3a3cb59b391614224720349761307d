The Inkatha Freedom Party Women s Brigade has called on government to hold an urgent summit about sexual violence after an 11-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her teacher at a school in KwaMaphumulo KwaZulu-Natal. We can no longer sit back and wait for the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign to start before we speak out about sexual violence said brigade leader Thembeni Madlopha Mthethwa. Rapists do not give women and children any chance as they prey on them every day of the year. She said there is a need for political will to treat the scourge as a priority. We need to see real commitment to go after the perpetrators. This summit should be a turning point in addressing sexual violence she said. TMG Digital
