Various church practices and beliefs have come under public scrutiny since the emergence of videos and photos of some men of the cloth involving their members in dangerous acts in the name of religion.For instance, Lethebo Rabalago of the Mount Zion General Assembly in Limpopo is using an insecticides spray to "exorcise demons" from his congregants.The infamous Pastor Penuel Mnguni not only instructed his congregants eat snakes, he went further to instruct them to lay on the floor and drove over them.Lesego Daniels of the Rabboni Centre Ministry became popular for alleging that God had instructed him to make his church members drink petrol and eat grass, which he likened to holy communion. When questioned, he simply argued that no one has died from consuming grass.Although he is right and that no reports have emerged on someone dying from consuming such, the pastor was still chastised and had his name dragged through the mud.In the light of these recent occurrences, Sowetan LIVE has looked at the different churches in SA and their beliefs and practices.Zionist/Apostolic and African traditional churchesThese are Zion Christian Church (ZCC) and St John's Church , churches use healing methods ranging from sprinkling with water on congregants during prayer for healing.Using enema to help cleanse yourself or heal some conditionsReverend Emmanuel Motolla of the popular Zion Christian Church (ZCC) said that these and more were among 'ditaelo' (loosely translated: prophecy instructions) that are consumed as per advise from the prophecy but with the emphasis that the tea and coffee have to be blessed."For healing, we use free blessed water. We use blessed tea, blessed coffee. We even use blessed salt. All these are used in accordance to the guidance from the prophecy under close supervision," Motolla told Sowetan.Roman Catholic churchesThey sprinkle water on the congregants and use incense to ward off evil spirits.They believe that the holy communion - wafers and wine are the actual body and blood of Christ.People who come to visit the church from other churches are not allowed to have the holy communion.Protestant churchesThese are churches like the Methodist, Lutheran and Uniting Reformed Church among others.They also believe in the holy communion just like the Catholic churches, they believe the wafers and wine are the actual body and blood of Christ."Every time we serve the holy communion, us as Christians, as believers, enter into a covenant with God," says Harvey Phalatse from the Uniting Reformed Church.Phalatse says that through the holy communion, the believers reflect on their sins and that the holy communion is not offered to those who "are not ready"."It (holy communion) is very sacred. It is viewed in a literal sense this is why we say - before handing it out - 'nka mona o je ke mmele waka' (take this and eat, it's my body), 'nka mona o je ke madi aka' (take this and drink, it's my blood)," explained Phalatse.Charismatic ChristianityThese are known as spirit-filled Christianity (Zalwane), which are churches that focuses on the holy spirit and spiritual gifts.They believe in miracles and that there are certain anointed people with healing and prophecy powers.
