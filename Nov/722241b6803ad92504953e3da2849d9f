Free State Stars have goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni to thank for being in the Telkom Knockout semifinals, where they'll face Cape Town City away.The the draw was conducted at Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban, immediately after Stars' 6-5 penalty shootout victory over Kaizer Chiefs yesterday.In the other semifinal, SuperSport United drew Orlando Pirates.Reacting to the draw, Bucs interim coach Augusto Palacios said his side would not be motivated by revenge.The semifinal draw pitted Palacios against a side that prompted his return to the Bucs bench, following his predecessor Muhsin Ertugral's resignation after Bucs' 6-1 annihilation by the Pretoria-based side in the league last week."For us it is not about revenge but to focus on the game to make the final. This is a knockout game," Palacios told Sowetan last night."It was a very bad loss but what happened [the heavy defeat] had passed now and we prepare players game by game. What is more important is to win to get our confidence back. "People will say 'look how you played against Highlands Park' but we still won the game."Free State Stars showed that there is no easy game and that any draw is difficult."Pirates booked their place in the last four courtesy of an own goal from Augustine Mbara and a strike from Tendai Ndoro in their 2-1 win over the Premiership newcomers at Orlando Stadium on Saturday.SuperSport eliminated holders Mamelodi Sundowns via penalties on Saturday night.Meanwhile, Ngobeni made two saves during the penalty shootout that sunk Chiefs in Durban, capping off a brilliant performance against his former side, four years after leaving with just one competitive match to his name.The man of the match made a series of good saves in both halves to help weather the storm against a Chiefs team that launched attack after attack. The game finished 2-2 at the end of extra time.Stars took the lead via left-back Bokang Thlone in the 10th minute, shooting with his right foot in wet conditions in Durban.Then it became a Ngobeni show, as the former junior international pulled off some good saves to keep his side in the lead.He made close to 10 saves in total, frustrating the Amakhosi players and technical team in the venue they were beaten by Sundowns in the final of the same competition last season.Ngobeni's best saves were in the second half. He first brilliantly tipped over Tshabalala's header for a corner in the 54th minute.A few minutes later he denied Michelle Katsvairo.Ngobeni was finally beaten late by an Edmore Chirambadare equaliser. In extra-time Thokozani Sekotlong scored for Stars before Mulomowandau Mathoho levelled the scores to take the game into penalties.Lorenzo Gordinho and William Twala failed to convert their spot-kicks as Stars emerged 6-5 winners. - additional reporting by Daniel Mothowagae
