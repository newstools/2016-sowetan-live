Bloemfontein Celtic are sifting through a bunch of CVs for potential coaches to replace Serame Letsoaka full-time but appear in no rush as they look to give co-caretaker coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka time to work with the team.Seema confirmed to Times Media Digital that no time-frame had been given to him on when a new coach might be appointed.The two coaches are continuing to prepare the side while Maduka is also doubling up as team manager. They [team management] have already said that the CVs are there so we will have to wait and see Seema said. As long as they haven t found somebody then we will continue to steer the ship and hopefully put it where they want it to be until they find the right man. The pair have been in charge for just one game a 1-0 loss at Cape Town City earlier this month when Celtic were unlucky not to grab a point at least.Had they buried their chances it might have been a comfortable win for the side.But the break in the league for the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals and international matches has given them two weeks grace before their next game against Polokwane City on November 20. We can work on some things especially in the final third " Seema said."The chances are there we are just rushing [the finish]. It s coming if we continue to fight then it looks promising. Both former Lesotho star Seema and ex-Malawi international Maduka were stalwarts for Celtic during their playing days.Phunya Sele Sele have a single win in eight games in all competitions this season and are 13th in the 16-team top-flight. - TMG Digital
