Reigning African Champions Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane faces another uncertain evening at Loftus Versfeld on Wednesday night by his own admission.He says he is not sure what approach he is going to get from his African Champions League-winning squad when they host Lamontville Golden Arrows.Mosimane has already bemoaned a lack of focus from his players in regular Premier Soccer League fixtures with the distraction of competing in FIFA s Club World Cup just around the corner for the Brazilians. I hope we are not sloppy but I don t know if the players badly want to win the game said Mosimane in a clear challenge to his charges to make sure they are consistent in their approach regardless who the opponents are.But he did admit there was no apathy on the part of the champions against arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend in a league match Sundowns should have won by a much more convincing score line than the 2-1 result in Pretoria. But Chiefs is Chiefs added Mosimane it is not a game you have to worry about the players being motivated for even if they are going to Japan .Saturday s victory pushed Sundowns up the table but they still have a major backlog of games that is only going to get worse when they go to Japan next month.Wednesday s home clash is just their fifth league outing but if the Brazilians win they will move into the top eight in the Absa Premiership standings for the first time this season.Unpredictable Arrows meanwhile can advanced to 20 points if they win for a sixth time in 10 matches. They scored late to beat Highlands Park 1-0 away in Tembisa on Sunday.Last season Arrows beat Sundowns at home and held them to a goalless draw in Pretoria. - TMG Digital
