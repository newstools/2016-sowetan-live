Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka worked with Stuart Baxter long enough to know that the former Bafana coach's focus is not divided.Baxter's SuperSport United side will face Amakhosi at FNB tonight (7.30pm) before taking on another Soweto giant, Orlando Pirates, in the Telkom Knockout semifinals on Saturday."We know the philosophy under Baxter. He's going to get his players pumped up for this game because this one is just as important as the semifinal. They have done very well in the past few games," said Maluleka, who has not quite found the form he had when Baxter was in charge at Chiefs."Knowing coach Stuart, we expect a lot of attack from all angles. We need to make sure we do all the right things."The defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday extended Chiefs' winless streak to four matches, but Maluleka said they've recovered from it and they were ready to get back to winning ways. "It's always disappointing to drop points, but we have to look forward," Maluleka said."I think getting the ball in the back of the net [has been the problem]. That has been the difference because you saw we drew some matches and those are games we could have won easily. There's a lot of work still to be done." l See Page 22
