Maintenance defaulters remain off the hook despite a 2015 amendment to the Maintenance Act meant to see defaulters blacklisted for not paying for the upkeep of their children.Regulations that govern the blacklisting of maintenance defaulters under the amended Maintenance Act will only be finalised next year, the Justice Department has said.So far, 17000 cases have been registered under the amended act, and in 6500 matters, criminal cases have been opened.Another 6000 cases were finalised under Section 26 of the amended Maintenance Act, which allows for blacklisting.The cases now hang in the balance.Section 26 says that once a court order has been granted against a maintenance defaulter, the court or a clerk of the court should forward the defaulter's details to "any business which has as its object the granting of credit or is involved in the credit rating of persons".In a written reply to a question from the DA in parliament, Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the regulations would be ready by "early 2017"."A set of draft regulations has been prepared and the credit bureaus, who are the key stakeholders in the implementation of these provisions, are being engaged," he said.The DA's Werner Horn, who posed the question, said government was once again dragging its feet on implementing key legislation: "This is not something that needs regulations, the Act is very specific, it says once you are found to be in default on maintenance, the court shall furnish the credit bureau with your personal particulars, so there is no discretion, there is nothing that calls for regulation. It must just be implemented."The Commission for Gender Justice said the regulations need to be expedited to ensure women don't feel neglected by the system.
