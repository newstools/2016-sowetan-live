If they supply to Tendai Ndoro is cut, then Baroka believe they can stop the Absa Premiership's most dangerous striker from adding to his tally of nine league goals.Right back Albert Mothupa watched Orlando Pirates closely in their defeat to SuperSport United in the Telkom Knockout at the weekend and picked up a few things he feels Baroka need to do to tame the league's top scorer.First, they need to close down wingers Luvuyo Memela and Thabo Rakhale. And then they need to make sure that Mpho Makola, a good passer of the ball, is kept quiet. Baroka host Pirates at Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm)."I watched them against SuperSport. They are dangerous on the wings and up front. I told my captain [Olaleng Shaku] that he should look after the middle and we will take care of the wingers like Memela, Rakhale and [Thabo] Qalinge," said Mothupa."Pirates play with wingers. They play the ball to Ndoro. He either lays it off to a teammate or he turns and shoots. If we close the supply to him, then we can do well. We need to collect maximum points because we come from a loss [against Bloemfontein Celtic]. If we lose, we will move down the table and we don't want that."Mothupa is hoping to come up against his nephew Gift Motupa. The reason their surnames are spelt differently is because there was an error made in Mothupa's ID book.The younger Motupa has not featured since Pirates lost 6-1 to SuperSport in the league about a month ago."I tried calling Gift but I have not been getting through to him. Maybe he does not want to speak to his uncle," Mothupa laughed. "I believe the Motupa family will be happy to see us playing."Tenth-placed Baroka are targeting to reach at least 17 points before the Christmas break. They are currently on 10.Tonight's Fixtures (all 7.30pm)Ajax v Sundowns, Cape Town Stadium; Golden Arrows v Polokwane City, King Zwelithini; FS Stars v Platinum Stars, Goble Park; Baroka v Pirates, Peter Mokaba; Highlands Park v Celtic, Makhulong Stadium
