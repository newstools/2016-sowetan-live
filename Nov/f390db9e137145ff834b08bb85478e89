The ANC may have retained 13 of the wards it contested in Wednesday's by-election, however, its support in eight of the wards has declined.This could have something to do with the low voter turnout during by-elections in general and this one was no different.According to the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) voter turnout varied this week from between 27.75% and 63.77% with an average of 43.51%.The governing party has expressed concern at the low turnout."For almost 105 years, the ANC, working with the people, has led the struggle for the liberation of all the people of South Africa in which they can all, black or white, enjoy the constitutional right to elect the government of their choice. Many sacrificed their lives for the right to vote," ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said."We should never fail them by staying away from voting."The ANC lost a ward to the EFF in Polokwane, saying it was disappointed by this.Ward 10 was contested by the ANC, EFF and Forum 4 Service Delivery. The ward became vacant after the previous ANC councillor resigned.The ANC had won the ward during the local government elections with 55.08% of the vote. This was a huge decline from the 2011 municipal elections, when the party won the ward with an overwhelming 90.27%.The EFF did not exist then. This time its candidate Jonas Mothapo won the ward with 54.21% of the vote.During the August 3 local government elections the ANC's electoral support had declined by eight percentage points. The party also lost control of four of the country's metros.Scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma seemed to be at the heart of the electoral decline for the ANC.Fifteen by-elections in six provinces - Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape and Western Cape.The DA managed to retain its ward in Kgatelopele in the Northern Cape.In the August poll the DA had won the ward with 40.95% of the vote, a margin they increased to 72.07% in the by-election this week. DA national spokeswoman Phumzile van Damme said despite only winning one ward, there was a "significant surge in growth" in support for the party.
