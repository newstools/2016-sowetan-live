The Economic Freedom Fighters on Friday called on the board of Eskom to follow CEO Brian Molefe s example in resigning to save parliament the energy and time of having to do it . Suffice to say if they do not EFF will make sure that parliament dissolves them as soon as possible party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. During his tenure is CEO Molefe had the audacity to lie to parliament when asked about his relations with the Gupta family specifically stating that he has never been to their home when in reality he did. The Eskom board on the other hand is an illegitimate board that should follow its mythomaniac CEO by immediately resigning so that a new board can be appointed... Ndlozi charged.Eskom features prominently in the Public Protector s state capture report which sheds light on the close friendship between Molefe and the Gupta family.The word Eskom appears 829 times.Cellphone records obtained by the Public Protector show that Molefe and Ajay Gupta exchanged 58 calls in eight months between 2015 and 2016.Brian Molefe is leaving EskomAjay is one of three brothers the other two being Atol and Rajesh Gupta whose business empire and alleged political influence have stirred up a hornet s nest of controversy in South Africa.The parastatal was a source of lucrative contracts for the Gupta family and Duduzane Zuma the son of President Jacob Zuma through a company called Tegeta.Tegeta secured a 10-year supply agreement with Eskom to supply coal to the Majuba power station. Tegeta also secured contracts to supply coal to the Hendrina and Arnot power stations.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela said in her report that a member of the Gupta family admitted to her during an interview on October 4 2016 that Molefe was his very good friend and often visited his home in the upmarket suburb of Saxonwold Johannesburg. Eskom s awarding of the initial contracts to Tegeta to supply coal to the Majuba Power Station will form part of the next phase of the investigation noted the report by Madonsela.Having considered the evidence uncovered during the investigation Madonsela said that it appeared that the board of Eskom was improperly appointed not in line with the spirit of the King III report on good Corporate Governance.A board appointed to a state-owned-enterprise was expected to act in the best interests of the country at all times but it appears that the board may have failed to do so she said.
