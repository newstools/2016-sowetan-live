Three Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) students arrested by the Hawks over an alleged extortion attempt are spending the weekend in police cells.The trio made a brief appearance at the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court . They were arrested on Tuesday.Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the students allegedly attempted to swindle a security firm owner out of R100000.They allegedly promised the unnamed owner that his or her contract with TUT would be extended upon payment.TUT's spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter has rubbished claims that students could influence the awarding of the institution's contracts.A Hawks undercover operation led to the trio's arrest, allegedly after they had received R40000 in cash.Mulaudzi said the students were believed to be members of the Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command (EFFSC) at TUT's main campus.In court, prosecutor Peter Serunye told magistrate Martin van Wyk that the case had been remanded to Monday.Serunye said this would give the state a chance to check if the three have previous and/or pending cases against them and also confirm their addresses.Each has been charged with a count of extortion, Serunye told the court.The students' lawyer, Advocate Matome Seima, said he would bring a formal bail application on Monday."I confirm that we have arranged that the matter be remanded to Monday."My instructions are that my clients don't have outstanding cases or warrants of arrest," Seima said."My instructions are to apply for bail for my three clients. We'll take it from there. At this stage, I cannot comment on the merits of the case."The trio cut sombre figures in the dock. The court's small gallery was filled with TUT students.Many were members of the EFFSC but some were from the ANC-aligned SA Students Congress.This is the latest round of arrests of students across the country this year.Almost 1000 are facing charges related to the #FeesMustFall protests.Deputy chairman of the EFFSC at TUT, Javis Valoyi, said their comrades should be presumed innocent until proven otherwise. nkosib@sowetan.co.za
