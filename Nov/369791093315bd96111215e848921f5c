With persistent heatwave posing yet another threat this weekend, runners participating in the Old Mutual Soweto Marathon need not worry as organisers have promised water galore along the route for the race on Sunday.Central Gauteng Athletics (CGA) president James Moloi said "the well-being and safety of the runners comes first and the rest will follow".Moloi said besides the searing heat, crucial lessons were learnt in the past where inadequate water points as well as chaotic scenes at the start marred the organisation of the previous editions of the tradition-steeped marathon."From the experiences of the past we felt that there was an urgent need to add more resources on the road, especially the hydration stations along the route. Now we have different companies sponsoring the water points at 3km intervals. The gap will narrow to 2km after the 35km mark in the 42km," said Moloi, who doubles as Athletics SA road running commission chairman."As the host province [CGA], we have put our weight behind the Soweto Marathon Trust, to give them all the necessary support as they are the organisers of the race. Otherwise, failure of this race will be failure of the province."Moloi also urged the expected 25 000 participants - across the 42km, 21km and 10km - to arrive early to minimise congestion at the start.One of the innovations in this year's race will see the finishers crossing the line inside FNB Stadium.The race will also start at the iconic 2010 Fifa World Cup final arena, and Moloi has invited the spectators to the venue free of charge, except in areas where accreditation will be required."We're excited that this race is becoming bigger and better, hence we moved it to FNB Stadium where there is even enough space for parking and movement."l The 42km race will start at 6am, 21km at 6.30am and the 10km at 7am.
