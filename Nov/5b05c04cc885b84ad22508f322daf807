"I was very close to my mother and we used to converse a lot. Her death has left a huge gap in the family as all of us used to rely on her for advice in life," he said."I find it difficult to cope with life after the death of my mother. The manner in which she was killed makes me spend sleepless nights thinking of her all the time."The victim's younger brother, Sekopo Mahlo, said it was still difficult for him to accept her death."The manner in which my sister died has left a scar in my heart. It will take time to heal," he said.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the case had been referred to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).
