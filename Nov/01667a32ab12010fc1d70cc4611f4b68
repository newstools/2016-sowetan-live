Bafana Bafana's clash against Senegal at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday will evoke memories of the past but coach Shakes Mashaba has urged the players to stay focused on the job at hand.The Polokwane venue is where the late Senzo Meyiwa played his last match for the national team - an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Congo in October 2014. Nine days after the 0-0 draw with Congo, Meyiwa was shot dead in Vosloorus.Some of the members of the current team who were there during Meyiwa's last match for the national team are Andile Jali, Rivaldo Coetzee and Thulani Serero.Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba admitted that playing in Polokwane will be "emotional" for the team."It is emotional and it does bring those memories back, but what else can we do? We've got to move on," he said after the team touched down in Polokwane this week.One of the things Mashaba cannot forget is the support Bafana received when they last played in Polokwane. The national team got a decent crowd in the match against Congo and Mashaba is hoping the fans will again come out in numbers to support the team.
