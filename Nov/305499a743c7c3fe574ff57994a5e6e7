The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) on Tuesday said it holds a strong view that the minimum wage ought to be R5000 and above .Spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said the league is not happy with the current proposal and is fully aware that this will mean immense alterations from employers . The ANCYL wishes to urge all stakeholders to reconsider the current proposal and make it better he said. As the ANCYL we wish to advise stakeholders to first conduct a study of living conditions and expenses of the least paid workers rather then looking at what employers say can pay workers. The most affected here are general workers domestic workers security guards and cleaners. These sectors are highly populated by the youth who some of them are parents heads of household and look after many dependants Mkhize added.The proposed national minimum wage of R3500 per month was presented to the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) by a panel of advisors on Sunday.The league s parent body the ruling ANC welcomed the announcement saying it goes a long way to giving effect to the electoral mandate to the ANC government to introduce a national minimum wage . The panel s report provides a clear way forward for the conclusion of a social compact between social partners under the guidance of Nedlac spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said. TMG Digital
