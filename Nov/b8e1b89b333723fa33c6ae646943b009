The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) will have to decide on the schedule for the murder case of Limpopo medical doctor Ndivhuwo Mudau, who is accused of stabbing his lover to death early last month.Yesterday, the Thohoyandou Magistrate's Court had to postpone proceedings for Mudau's formal bail application after the state and the defence could not reach an agreement on what schedule it fell under.Prosecutor Mashudu Nekhumbe told the court the state wanted to proceed under Schedule Five, while the defence wanted to have the matter classified as a Schedule One offence. Now the DPP will have to issue a certificate declaring the specific schedule for the case.In terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, in a Schedule Five matter, the court will order that the accused remain in custody, unless they produce evidence showing that it is in the interest of justice to grant them bail. Schedule One is usually for minor offences such as assault. In such cases, the state has to prove why it would not serve the interests of justice to have a suspect released.Mudau, 24, was making his third appearance after handing himself over to authorities late last month following a manhunt which lasted for days. The lifeless body of his University of Venda student girlfriend Refilwe Masinamela, 23, had been discovered inside his residence room at Tshilidzini Hospital.Bail application has been postponed to November 17.
