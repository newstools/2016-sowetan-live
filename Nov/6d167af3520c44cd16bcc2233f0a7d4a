The Democratic Alliance will table a motion in the North West Legislature resolving that Premier Supra Mahumapelo must choose to put the people of the North West first and reject what it calls a ridiculous plan to buy himself a lavish private jet using public money.The DA s leader in the province Joe McGluwa said that in a province with the highest unemployment rate in South Africa at a shocking 44.6% it was simply unconscionable that Supra could put himself first and prepare to purchase a multi-million rand jet rather than spend money on creating jobs and opportunities. Premier Mahumapelo must stop his delusions of aviation grandeur and face the realities of the North West: Our people do not have jobs because his government has failed to grow the economy failed to create jobs and professionalised corruption with irregular expenditure increasing by R1 billion this year alone now totalling R3 billion a year. A choice to rather support the growth of Mahikeng airport would instead create a public benefit allowing better connections to our province for business and investment tourism and trade. Our province needs the connections of a more available Mahikeng airport not a luxury jet for ANC political elites said McGluwa.He added that at a time when gold and platinum prices were at all time lows the mining sector in the province was under strain and jobs were at risk. This is further reason for public money to rather be spent on creating new employment sectors by incentivizing and bringing investment to our province. Just like President Jacob Zuma Supra clearly believes that public money is available for their own benefit putting themselves first and South Africa last. The DA will not let Supra push through a luxury jet that will have no benefit for the people of the North West. We demand money is spent on creating jobs not jets. Premier Mahumapelo must do the right thing and must dismiss this jet purchase right out of hand McGluwa said.
