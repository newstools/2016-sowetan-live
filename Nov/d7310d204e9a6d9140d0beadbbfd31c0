The pace at which foreigners are selling local bonds rose last week helping to explain the slide in the rand against the dollar after Donald Trump s US presidential victory.Foreigners off-loaded a net R9bn worth of local bonds last week the fifth successive week of bond outflows. Offshore investors sold a net R1.86bn the week before.The sell-off pushed the yield on the benchmark R186 bond above the 9% mark for the first time in weeks and the rand weakened as much as 5% against the dollar last week.The bond market is reeling on expectations of higher state spending under Trump which analysts say will probably push up US inflation and interest rates.The potential for higher rate favours the dollar at the expense of the emerging-market currencies. Higher US rates enhance the dollar s appeal as they boost returns on assets denominated in that currency.Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said that while emerging markets were hit by hawkish sentiment they were better able to handle the fallout now than in previous months.Foreigners sold a net R6.65bn in local equities last week lifting the tally of equities sold in 2016 to R107.4bn.
