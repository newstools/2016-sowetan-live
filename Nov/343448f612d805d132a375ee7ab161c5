The 2016/17 PSL season is likely to conclude on June 17, but it could well be even at a later stage.This is because Mamelodi Sundowns will be participating in the Fifa Club World Cup to be hosted by Japan from December 8 to 18.According to PSL boss Irvin Khoza, the league is looking at ensuring that the Brazilians are in Asia at least four days before their first match on December 11.Khoza said the PSL will do everything in its power to ensure Sundowns don't just add to the numbers at the Club World Cup.Khoza will know the importance of travelling early to Asia to prepare, because his team Orlando Pirates, who won the CAF Champions League in 1995, went on to play South Korean side Ilhwa Chunma in the Afro-Asian Club Championship."I did indicate to the board of governors that when we qualified for the inter-continental championships against the team in South Korea, we were not aware that there was a nine-hour time difference, and when we got there, it was 2am and we had to go to training," he recalled."The body clock was saying 9am while it was 2am, so it was difficult for the players to adjust and our players lost 5-0 (away, after drawing 0-0 at home)," he said.Depending on their progress in the Club World Cup, the PSL may be forced to postpone Sundowns matches against Wits, SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates between December 7 and 16.
