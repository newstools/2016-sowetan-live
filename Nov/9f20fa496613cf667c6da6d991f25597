The Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu) on Monday rejected the proposed national minimum wage (NMW) of R3500 as inappropriate and far from addressing the treble challenges of unemployment inequality and poverty .Instead the union said it will push for the NMW to be as low as R5700 a month . Fawu general secretary Katishi Masemola said that Fawu will not only make submissions but wage campaigns because this country cannot afford to be the case-study of treble challenges and social ills .Fawu s campaign will call for:- The introduction of new taxes especially wealth and reparation taxes;- An increased rate of both PAYE and corporate taxes to apartheid-days levels; and - A 10% tax to cash reserves by all be it listed companies privately owned companies or NGOs/POBs trade unions and other civil society organisations. Masemola also said that Fawu does not understand the rationale for a possible exclusion couched as special consideration to both the domestic sector employing close to 1.2-million workers and agricultural sector (employing about 800 000) in this newly announced proposed NMW .
