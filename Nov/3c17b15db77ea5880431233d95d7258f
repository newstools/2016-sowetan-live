What a difference a match makes, particularly at test level.For South African left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj that match was the first test against Australia at the Waca, where he made his debut.South Africa won by 177 runs despite losing Dale Steyn to a fractured shoulder. That ballooned the workload of SA's remaining fast bowlers - Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander - and thrust a key role on Maharaj.Happily for all of them they came through with flying colours."As much as Dale going down did affect us, we didn't let it bother us in the second innings," Maharaj said."KG and Vern put their hands up beautifully and we just focused on what we had to do."What did Maharaj have to do? What Paul Harris did for South Africa for most of his 37 tests - the dirty work.Harris, also a left-arm spinner, was rarely tossed the ball with instructions to get people out.Instead he was ordered to suffocate them into submitting at the other end of the pitch.Maharaj knew that could be his lot in this series and he prepared accordingly."I did have a chat with 'Harro' before I got here and he had a few thoughts about bowling in Australian conditions."He said your job here is to rest the fast bowlers because conditions are in their favour rather than yours, and you will pick up a few wickets along the way."That Maharaj did like a seasoned test bowler.
