South Africa, Cameroon and Ghana are likely to have a common goal in their approach to the CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations semifinals today.The trio will look to pave the way to the final in their ultimate mission to halt a series of near-misses having been the runners-up on three or more occasions.Banyana have suffered four defeats in the decider, two to Nigeria, who they face in the second semifinal at Stade Limbe tonight (8pm).Hosts Cameroon have been on the losing side three times in the final, same as Ghana who they meet in Yaounde at 5pm.However, before the quartet think about the final on Saturday, they have a job to do today.Banyana pulled off a magical act in rescuing their campaign with a 5-0 demolition of Egypt on Friday, while Cameroon and Ghana breezed through to the last four. Though it would be an almost impossible task to repeat such heroics against Nigeria, interim coach Desiree Ellis will still be hopeful that her charges draw inspiration from the 2014 win over the "Super Falcons".With battle-scarred soldiers like Janine van Wyk, Nompumelelo Nyandeni, Mamello Makhabane and Jermaine Seoposengwe picking form at the right time, Banyana have every reason to believe going into tonight's epic clash.
