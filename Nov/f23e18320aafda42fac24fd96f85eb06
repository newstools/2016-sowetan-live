Ahead of their CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations clash today, one of the obvious differences between Cameroon and Banyana Banyana is that the West African nation has more overseas-based players.As many as 10 "Indomitable Lionesses" are scattered around the world in countries such as the US and Sweden, including forward Gaelle Deborah Enganamouit who plays for Swedish club Damallsvenskan.Enganamouit is the reigning African Women's Footballer of the Year. Like in the men's game, African countries with most players abroad are considered stronger.Banyana boast only two overseas-based players in US-based striker Jermaine Seoposenwe and goalkeeper Roxanne Barker, who turns out for SC Heerenveen in the Netherlands.Seoposenwe - who plies her trade at Samford University - has argued that Cameroon having many players based overseas doesn't mean they are stronger.The 23-year-old is set to start against the hosts in today's Group A clash at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium (5pm SA time). Seoposenwe came in as a late substitution in Banyana's goalless draw against Zimbabwe owing to her late arrival in camp due to study and club commitments."I always don't want to believe there is pressure on me," Seoposenwe said when asked about the expectations since she is based overseas and is considered one of the best players."I think it is going to be a hard one against Cameroon, but me being [based] overseas doesn't put me under pressure."I think our team is balanced. We all have our jobs to do on the pitch, so my job is to score goals; and if I don't do that I feel like I let my team down," she said.Seoposenwe's main concern is the lack of fire-power in their opening game.But for the Cameroon clash, she said she feels more rested and can power Banyana to victory. "As forwards, I think we need to take the responsibility and not squander the chances that we get," said Seoposenwe, who flew from the US to join her teammates for the continental tournament that kicked off on Saturday.Cameroon and SA have met 14 times and Banyana have the edge with six wins to the hosts' five victories, while three ended in draws.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe will face Egypt in another Group A clash tonight.l All the Women's Afcon games are live on SS9, with the Banyana action on SS4.
