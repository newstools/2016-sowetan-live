Anglican Bishop Jo Seoka has commended the legal representatives representing Mcebo Dlamini for doing a sterling job during the bail appeal of the Fees Must Fall leader. Comrades it was a good day. Our lawyers and advocates were outstanding and extremely brilliant today. They presented the case step-by-step to show that your comrade [Dlamini] brother and friend has been set up for political reasons said Seoka.He was addressing a group of students who had gathered outside the Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court in Katlehong on the East Rand on Tuesday.He echoed Advocate Dali Mpofu s argument in court that Dlamini was being kept behind bars to settle political scores. This is a struggle for students about the students by the students to get free education that is decolonized yet it has turned into a political issue for no other reason but for people to use the state apparatus to fight thier own struggle said the bishop.Seoka has previously been accused by the African National Congress of encouraging violence during the crisis gripping tertiary institutions over fees.The governing party then called on students to distance themselves from Seoka and the violence saying it is delegitimised their genuine protest.The bishop commended Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng for handling the case with fairness. The judge has been really fair in listening as we hope that tomorrow he will make a judgment that will make our hearts joyful he said.Mokgoatlheng will rule on Wednesday on whether Dlamini will be released on bail.
