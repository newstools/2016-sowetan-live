AfriForum did not mention the other statements but TMG Digital reported on Monday night that the Democratic Alliance and the Freedom Front Plus were mulling legal action over Malema s comment that we are not calling for the slaughter of white people at least for now .Malema made this comment on Monday after he appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 for for calling on people to occupy vacant land around the country. AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets said: It is evident that Malema drives a populist agenda and that he does not heed the realities that South Africa faces or the sustainability of his proposed solutions.
