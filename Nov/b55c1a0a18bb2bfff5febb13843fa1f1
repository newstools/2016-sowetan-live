We have to check so there's an enquiry," said Mulaudzi.He said that as the Hawks they are concerned about the Fidelity bags that are visible in the bag."The only problem we have is why are there Fidelity bags in there," he said.Mulaudzi added that they have not received any reports of robbery and that there are no suggestions that this is linked to anything of that nature.Watch: Video by Intelligence Bureau SA (Facebook)
