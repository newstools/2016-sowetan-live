"It means so much and it is certainly not something I expected to be awarded or even to have my name thrown in the mix with the talented players we saw nominated Barrett said. It's a by-product of a couple of great teams I have been a part of this year the Hurricanes and the All Blacks. I have to thank the coaches and my team-mates around me because without them I wouldn't be here." SA referee Rasta Rasivhenge was joint winner of the World referee award with Spain s Alhambra Nievas.
