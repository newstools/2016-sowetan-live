Sanity has finally prevailed - provincial boxing champions are getting belts and thanks to Sowetan for the unyielding pressure on the authorities to award them.Those who won provincial titles will at least have something to show when they have long retired.Jeff "911" Magagane was the first Gauteng provincial champion to receive his belt.He out-pointed Michael Mokoena for the lightweight title over 10 rounds in the main bout of a Supreme Boxing Promotions bill in Randburg, Johannesburg, on October 23.Magagane is trained by Alan Toweel Junior.Promoter Andre Thysse is responsible for the belt."To be acknowledged by Gauteng, my province, I approached Archie Nyingwa [(Gauteng provincial manager] about the belt. Nyingwa is a Gauteng board member."If you want to do something in Gauteng, you go to him. So he approved it," said Thysse, a former SA and Commonwealth super middleweight champion, who promotes under the banner of Real Steel Promotions.Boxing South Africa (BSA) chief Tsholofelo Lejaka warned that every initiative that seeks to promote the sport was welcome but had to be done in consultation with BSA."BSA welcomes all initiatives from individuals, corporates, civil society and government organs who come up with ways that seek to promote boxing."BSA alone cannot achieve the dictates imposed on the board by the Boxing SA Act and regulations to grow the sport," Lejaka said."But because we are the regulator and the custodians of the Boxing Act and regulations, when anybody comes up with these initiatives, it is important for such to happen in consultation with BSA."Prior approval is sought to ensure that there are no duplications or contradictions and that there is no undue encroachment into the patency rights of BSA or fellow licensees."Lejaka added: "We have noted that out of goodwill there are people who came up with these initiatives and processed them outside the procedural communication with BSA."In this regard it is part of the communication we are currently doing to reinforce our message that while initiatives are welcomed, it is important to do them in a coordinated way."
