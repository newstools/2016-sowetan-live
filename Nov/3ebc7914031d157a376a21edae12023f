Escaping a life of poverty has been citied as one of the driving factors in the success of East African runners in big-money marathons around the world.The story is no different on South African roads as major local titles are firmly in the grip of Ethiopians, with Kenya, Lesotho and Zimbabwe runners mostly left to jostle for runner-up spots - and locals filling up the last gaps in the top 10.About R1.5-million in first prize winnings has been claimed by Ethiopia's men and women alone in a space of seven months.On Sunday, the Soweto Marathon produced yet another solid Ethiopian sweep with Sintayehu Yinesu completing a treble of wins in the men's race, while Selam Alebachew and Chelitu Asefa made it a 1-2 in the women's event. Yinesu and Alebachew pocketed a combined R440000 prize money for their efforts, a loot the two said goes a long way in "supporting our families back home". Alebachew also won the Mandela Marathon in Pietermaritzburg in August."Running and winning big money improves our lives because it takes us out of everyday challenges such as poverty," the champions said through the translation of Belay Hagos, who manages the team of elite Ethiopians competing on these shores. Hagos also emphasised that the hefty prize money on offer "changes the lives of these athletes back home"."We can't deny that some of our athletes come from extreme poverty and they have big families to feed once they win these prize monies. Yinesu has one child but he is expected to support his extended family in Addis Ababa, like Selam."Hagos, however, said the race approach of his compatriots was not one way as his camp was also willing to impart their skills to local runners. But there has been little response, he said.Hagos, an endurance runner in his day, used to train with local distance running icon Hendrick Ramaala at the Zoo Lake grounds in Johannesburg."Some of my athletes are still training there and I always invite South Africans and most of them promise to come but they never do. South Africans have treated us nicely and it is only fair for us to share our knowledge in running."Hagos disputed the perception that his athletes were not of high standards, as most of them are yet to set the world's major city marathons ablaze. He backed up his argument with Meseret Biru, who won the Paris Marathon last year at the back of Cape Town and Soweto races triumphs.While South Africans have reclaimed the Comrades Marathon from foreign hold, it is in the standard marathons where locals still have a lot of ground to cover.SA's triumph in the Soweto Marathon dates back to Michael Mazibuko's win in 2011 and Rene Kalmer's feat in 2009.
