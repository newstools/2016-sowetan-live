ANC leaders believe their party and its government are at their weakest and are always shooting themselves in the foot.This was communicated by national executive committee (NEC) members Enoch Godongwana and Joel Netshitenzhe as well as Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas at the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals' (Absip) annual conference in Sandton, Johannesburg, yesterday.Jonas said erratic and unpredictable politics were not helping either, and the developmental state was hamstrung by corruption.His views were supported by Netshitenzhe, who said the government was communicating confusion, weakness and self-immolation while Godongwana said the criminal charges laid against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were a major blunder.Jonas said the country was facing serious political and economic challenges.He proposed SA cultivate three new obsessions - renewed, inclusive and vigorous industrialisation, stronger government that is less corrupt, and education and skills development."We need exceptional leadership. Exceptional leadership is a non-negotiable."Jonas would not comment on the public protector's State of Capture report after his speech.Netshitenzhe, also the executive director of the Mapungubwe Institute of Strategic Reflection, said the Marikana massacre, #FeesMustFall protests, spy tapes, the torching of schools in Vuwani, the R246-million upgrade of President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead, and state capture would not have happened if black professionals, black intellectuals and "organic" intellectuals were as prolific as they were before 1994.Godongwana, who is chairman of the ANC NEC's economic transformation subcommittee, said he felt vindicated by National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams's decision to drop the charges against Gordhan on the eve of his court appearance last week."Charging Gordhan was a major blunder. I feel vindicated by the dropping of charges against him."Godongwana was among the ANC leaders who broke ranks with many of Zuma's supporters by backing GordhanHe said his support was not just about Gordhan, but about institutions and their integrity.He said there was no cohesion in the government's executive arm.Gordhan was charged with fraud last month for approving the early retirement of former acting SA Revenue Service commissioner Ivan Pillay, who was also facing similar charges along with his successor Oupa Magashula.Godongwana said he did not know what the implications of the public protector's report would be because state capture was a new phenomenon.
