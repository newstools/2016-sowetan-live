The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has reached a compromise on ANC leadership by publicly endorsing Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma.However, it will not take a public stance on calls from some of its affiliates for Zuma to step down.Cosatu resolved at its central executive committee (CEC) meeting this week to support Ramaphosa to lead the party as president of the ANC when Zuma steps down next year.General secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said federation bosses reflected on the "political gridlock" currently in the ANC.". after intense and robust debate the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the ANC, comrade Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the reins as the president of the ANC."The federation is the first in the alliance to pronounce on its preference, despite a statement released by the ANC last week urging the federation and its affiliates to steer clear of the party's leadership debate until the appropriate time.The move is a blow for Zuma and his allies who are pushing for African Union commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over.Ramaphosa has a tough face-off against Dlamini-Zuma, who enjoys the support of her ex-husband and the so-called premier league, which includes the premiers of North West, Mpumalanga and Free State.She also has the endorsement of the ANC Youth League and ANC Women's League, which has called on the party to field a female candidate in the 2019 elections.Cosatu also dismissed the criticism Ramaphosa has been facing over his role in the Marikana massacre, saying it was a ploy to discredit the ANC-led government but not necessarily the ANC deputy president as an individual leader."You keep raising Marikana when the commission was put in place and Cyril was not found guilty. Things will be raised, it doesn't matter who leads the ANC, this war is not against individuals, but against the ANC. They [opposition parties] want regime change," said Cosatu's second deputy president Zingiswa Losi.Tyoto James, Cosatu's first deputy president, said it should be remembered that it was Ramaphosa who "liberated" workers during apartheid. "We should not forget that Cyril Ramaphosa founded the NUM [National Union of Mineworkers] and became its founding general secretary. It was through his actions that mineworkers were liberated from the prison-like conditions in the mines."The CEC also came out in support of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture to look into the alleged corrupt relationship between Zuma, cabinet ministers and the Gupta family.However, it cautioned against the "public lynching" of those not yet found guilty by the courts.Cosatu's decision to support Ramaphosa is widely seen as a slap in the face of its president Sdumo Dlamini, a staunch Zuma supporter who wanted the federation to rally behind a candidate from an ANC camp aligned to himself.Dlamini, who attended yesterday's press conference, did not speak on the issue.
