The SABC has for over two years owed South Africa s musicians R25.7 million in royalty payments.This was disclosed in a reply to a Democratic Alliance parliamentary question.According to the reply two societies representing musicians SA Music Performance Rights Association (SAMPRA) and Independent Music Performance Rights Association (IMPRA) have been owed this amount since 2014 by the SABC s radio division. This flies in the face of (SABC boss Hlaudi) Motsoeneng s constant pontificating claims to support South Africa s local musicians said DA MP Phumzile van Damme. His 90% local content policy has now been revealed to be nothing more than an attempt to gain the public support of South Africa s musicians during his legal woes as it is not backed by a real commitment to provide the financial backing in royalty payments. Van Damme said she will be following up on the payments. We will submit further parliamentary questions to find out when the outstanding monies will be paid to our country s musicians. The DA fully supports South Africa s musicians and will fight to make sure that the SABC pays back the money.
