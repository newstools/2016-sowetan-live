RACISM has again sullied a South African cricket tour of Australia, with Hashim Amla singled out for abuse this time."Hashim Amla terrorist," is the message believed to have been written on a fence near the South African team's dugout at Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Saturday, the first day of the second Test.Cricket Australia (CA) said a 24-year-old man suspected of committing the act had been banned from attending any official match in Australia for three years and had been summoned to appear in court."Tasmania police identified the person of interest through CCTV and witnesses in the area," a CA spokesman told reporters."CA takes a zero-tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour at any of our matches, which includes racial vilification."The South Africans seem to have been satisfied that sufficient action has been taken."We have been informed that the man has been formally charged and has been handed a three-year ban from the stadium," team manager Mohammed Moosajee said."From our point of view, it is disappointing and disconcerting because this is not the first act of racial vilification we have received while touring Australia over the years."It is unacceptable. There is absolutely no place for racial stereotyping and such offensive acts in society, let alone in sport."The incident is the latest in a list of racial run-ins South Africans have had with Australians.Former fast bowler Makhaya Ntini complained of racist abuse from the crowd at the WACA in Perth in December 2005.In August 2006 former Australian batsman Dean Jones called Amla a "terrorist" while he thought he was off-air while working as a television commentator during South Africa's tour to Sri Lanka.Jones was fired.l No play was possible on day two of the second Test between Australia and SA yesterday. SA were 171/5 at stumps on Saturday in reply to Australia's total of 85.
