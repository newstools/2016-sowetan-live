Adelaide - Quinton de Kock is a month away from his 24th birthday and has played only a dozen Tests but South Africa will look to follow his lead against Australia in Adelaide on Thursday - the visitors first pink-ball day/night Test. The beauty with Quinton de Kock and the way he plays is the simplicity he gave with that answer about the pink ball South African coach Russell Domingo said with reference to a tour match played in Adelaide under the same conditions last month in which De Kock scored 99. He said it s just another ball. Someone asked him about batting at dusk. He said it was the easiest time to bat. So that s the sort of attitude we re going into it with. It s just another cricket ball. It might be a different colour but we re playing on a cricket pitch and they ve all played under lights before. More than the groundbreaking conditions Domingo was more interested in the chance South Africa had to inflict the first 3-0 loss on Australia at home. That s what our focus is on Domingo said. We re not too concerned about whether (the ball is) pink white or red - we just want to play the Test match. But Domingo didn t expect the home side to go quietly despite the fact that they have lost five Tests consecutively and have made six changes to their squad of 12. In my time as coach or as a young person watching cricket I don t think there s ever been an Australian team that s just given up or been easy to beat Domingo said. It s going to be no different this time. I suppose they ve taken more abuse than we have over the last couple of weeks and they ll be quite happy with what s happened (with the media furore over the ball-tampering charges faced by Faf du Plessis) because it s lessened the load on them. But we know they ll be desperate to do well. - TMG Sport
