Banyana Banyana paid a heavy price for defending too deep as they lost 1-0 to Cameroon in their CAF Women Africa Cup of Nations Group A clash yesterday.Banyana were on their way to securing a draw that could have boosted their chances of reaching the knockout phase, but let slip when substitute Genevieve Ngo Mbeleck pounced six minutes from regulation time.Buoyed by their multitude of fans, the hosts took the match to Banyana until the SA defence collapsed under pressure. The win confirmed Cameroon's place in the semifinals with six points and a game to spare.For Banyana, the loss means they remain on one point and risk being knocked out in the group stage of the tournament for only the third time in their history.As it stands, SA's chances are hanging by a thread after Egypt defeated Zimbabwe 1-0 in another group match last night.Banyana must beat Egypt in their final group match on Friday (5pm) and hope that Cameroon hold off Zimbabwe on the same day.Egypt are now second on the log with three points, while Zimbabwe, like SA, have one point.
