Shakes Mashaba is almost certain to be sacked as Bafana Bafana coach after the SA Football Association dramatically suspended him last night.A weekend where Bafana celebrated a heroic 2-1 win over Senegal concluded with disciplinary action being taken against the head coach following what has been described as his unbecoming behaviour in the aftermath of the match in Polokwane.Independent sources told Sowetan last night that Mashaba flatly refused to shake hands with a powerful Safa delegation led by president Danny Jordaan and chief executive Dennis Mumble after they had come to the Peter Mokaba Stadium pitch to congratulate him for the victory."He simply ignored them and started shouting, saying 'I did this without anyone's support'."This seemed directed at the Safa leadership," a source who was mid-pitch during the incident said.Mashaba continued his rant even as SABC cameras waited for him to conduct a mandatory post-match TV interview, prompting the anchors to delay the interview by a few minutes."It would have been bad to put him on TV when he was raging like that. He was having a go at everyone, pointing fingers at the media and Safa in particular, saying they wanted him out so their friends can be given the (Bafana) job," an SABC employee said."We had to delay the interview because he was not in a state to go live on air."A Safa insider said this was almost certainly the end of the road for Mashaba after Safa took the drastic step of suspending him before Bafana's a friendly away in Mozambique tomorrow."This is it. There's no coming back for the coach because he had been warned of his behaviour before. There will be more charges added due to his frequent attacks on the media," the insider said.The decision to suspend Mashaba was taken on Saturday night and, by yesterday after he had calmed down, he apparently offered his apology to the Safa leadership."Today (yesterday) he was more remorseful, telling us that he did that in the heat of the moment, but there's simply no excuse for this kind of behaviour," a source said.It was unclear when Mashaba's disciplinary hearing would be. He was barred from travelling with the team to Maputo, where assistant coach Owen Da Gama will be in charge.Mashaba could not be reached for comment.
