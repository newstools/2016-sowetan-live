Sandile Ndlovu used his lens to take a closer look at a business started by a former mineworker after he was retrenched, and then was inspired by his artistic talent and entrepreneurial skill to feed his family.The display of stylish furniture made from old car tyres is hard to miss as you drive along the busy N11 road from Mokopane in Limpopo leading towards the Botswana border.These are the creations of Limpopo resident Thabo Maringa who believes that losing his mining job helped him to discover his entrepreneurial talent and start the lucrative business.Maringa, 43, is a father of four from Phola Park village outside Mokopane. He is one of many people who now make a living from turning old car tyres into furniture and other usable items.Until his retrenchment in October last year, Maringa worked as a fitter for a platinum mining company in the Mahwelereng area, becoming one of many people hit by major job cuts in the country's mining industry in recent years.Statistics shows that SA's unemployment rate increased to 27.1% of the labour force in the first quarter of 2016, up from 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015.Maringa, who now survives by making furniture and other artefacts from recycled car tyres, recalled how the pressure of job loss led him to start the business."I developed stress because it was the time where children were looking at me to buy them food and clothes for Christmas. And I knew I was not good to provide for them because it is not easy to find a job these days, let alone during the festive season," said Maringa.He now recycles rubber tyres into home furniture, fashion and voerbakke, which are stock animals' feedlots. His workshop is his home. Maringa also makes traditional sandals, doormats and swings which he sells to local cr che owners. Maringa believes that the retrenchment opened up his mind to other possibilities."I am happy that I was retrenched because I wouldn't have started this business. Though [at first] I was worried as to how we were going to survive with my family, but later I discovered that it was a blessing in disguise."In townships and villages across the country young children use tyres as toys, something that Maringa himself can attest to."When I was a child we used to take two sticks, cover its front tip with plastic and put it inside a tyre with some water. Our parents could not afford to buy us toys and that was our car when we were growing up."His love of nature introduced him to art while in Standard 1 (now Grade 3)."I love nature, as a result I used to make wild animal sculptures and draw landscapes."Maringa collects tyres that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles, due to wear or irreparable damage.Though capital is a challenge, Maringa wants to see the level of unemployment reduced in five years as he hopes to formalise his business and employ more people."I want to see myself owning a big business and creating more jobs to close the gap of unemployment. I would be happy to see my business helping more people to put food on the table."He said children should be encouraged to pursue entrepreneurship at an early age so that they don't rely on employment, but rather create employment."I am already teaching my five-year-old son to do artwork. I want him to be an entrepreneur so that he can create jobs for others."During a recent economic development summit in the province, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa called for government to empower small businesses.A few kilometres away from Maringa's home, Winnie Mangenge and her family feel protected from lightning after placing a rubber tyre on the roof of their home at Tshamahansi village.Most villagers put tyres on the roofs of their homes, claiming to be protected from lightning. However, according to the Lightning Protection Institute, "Lightning protection is way too expensive for the average homeowner. Rubber tyres protect you from lightning in a car by insulating you from the ground". But, Mangenge is adamant that she is protected from lightning."When there is a tyre on the roof we are safe from lightning. Since I was born, my parents used this technique and no one has been stricken by lightning at home."According to the Rubber Association of Canada, "less than 5% of the used tyres worldwide are being recycled". Maringa's business is one of the few helping to eradicate pollution .ndlovusa@sowetan.co.za
