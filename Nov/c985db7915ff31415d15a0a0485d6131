It will be a case of picking horses for courses when Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba selects the team to face Senegal in tomorrow's 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Peter Mokaba Stadium (3pm).Mashaba could be tempted to go with the same starting 11 that delivered an impressive display against Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou last month, but only to let it slip at the death for a 1-1 draw.In defence, for instance, defender Rivaldo Coetzee has returned to the side after he missed the match against the Burkinabe with a hamstring injury.Erick Mathoho and captain Thulani Hlatshwayo were partnered in Coetzee's absence, while Eleazar Rodgers was given a run and came close to scoring on a couple of occasions, especially in the second half when he missed with a header.Now, however, Lars Veldwijk has been the talk of town since he was drafted into the squad for his maiden call-up. The towering striker is widely expected to start ahead of Rodgers but by yesterday, Mashaba had given little away on his plans for the Belgium-based marksman.Mashaba said yesterday that he was not worried that some players were not available due to injuries, such as Dean Furman and Tebogo Langerman, who have been released from camp, or how those picked played in the last match.For Mashaba, it is about picking players having considered how attacking the Senegal side is."One thing that we are boasting about in Bafana these days is that if anything happens to any player and if we need to replace someone, we don't have problems. We have widened the base," he said."What controls us is the kind of opposition that we play and that determines which team we are going to put on going forward."As has been the norm since Mashaba returned to the hot seat two years ago, he is likely to announce the starting 11 later today or early tomorrow morning.
