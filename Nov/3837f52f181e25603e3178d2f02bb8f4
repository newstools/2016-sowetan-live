The ANC s Zizi Kodwa said on Sunday that the proposal provides a clear way forward for the conclusion of a social compact between social partners under the guidance of Nedlac and said constituences are urged to proceed with urgency so that finality and certainty can be achieved .However the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) noted on Sunday that following proposals by worker organisations like Cosatu had tabled a minimum wage of R4500 to Parliament based on figures from 2014 which is two years ago .The proposed national minimum wage of R3500 was presented to Nedlac by a panel of advisors appointed to advise it on the level at which the country s national minimum wage should be set.Addressing the media after the panel s report was presented to Nedlac Ramaphosa said labour government and business would need to take this proposal to their constituencies to decide whether or not this was acceptable to them. We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is. He said the parties would discuss the proposal and come back to Nedlac. If there was agreement this would be made into legislation. TMG Digital
