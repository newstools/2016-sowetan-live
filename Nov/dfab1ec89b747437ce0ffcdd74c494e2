Lamontville Golden Arrows might have lost a little recent momentum as coach Clinton Larsen admits but they remain just two points off the top of the table and still competitive.Arrows who are away in Tembisa on Sunday afternoon against Highlands Park have won only one of their last five outings but have been hampered by injury. We lost some key players particularly Lerato Lamola and Lehlohonolo Nonyane and that affected us Larsen told TMG Sport on Wednesday. We had to shuffle players around and play some out of position and we brought [Mauricio] Barrios in perhaps a little early while he was still not fully fit. It did set us back a little bit but we were competitive in all of those games. We have our small targets and if we get one win from our next two games then we remain right on course with where we want to be. Arrows are up against champions Mamelodi Sundowns away on Wednesday after the match against Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium (3.30pm). Lamola is likely to be back in the squad for the weekend but Nonyane is still not ready to take his return from a groin strain added Larsen. Arrows are also without suspended Kagisho Dikgacoi and Nkanyiso Mngwengwe both of whom got their marching orders in Arrows last game against Platinum Stars which they lost 1-0 at home. They sit out two games each. - TMG Sport
