An Australian commentator yesterday came under fire yesterday for claiming that cricketer Kagiso Rabada, SA's hero in their first test win over the Aussies, hails from a "village".Former Australia test captain Ian Chappell's comment irked South Africans watching the final day of the first test at the WACA, with some labelling him a racist and an idiot. SA won the match by 177 runs, with Rabada claiming the man-of-the-match award.Chappell was commentating for Channel 9, an Australian channel, when Rabada skittled the Australian middle order and snared a five-wicket haul.The commentator initially was full of praise for the talented 21-year-old and joined fellow commentator Ian Healy in labelling the fast bowler a future superstar of the game.But he put his foot in it with a thoughtless comment that some found racist on the basis that he seemed to stereotype Rabada to be automatically from a "village" on the basis of his race.When Healy asked Chappell how Rabada could have developed such speed in his bowling, Chappell replied: "You'd have to ask all the batsmen in his village."It seemed to have escaped Chappell's mind that Rabada actually grew up in Johannesburg. His parents stay in Fourways and he attend private schooling at St Stithians College, where he honed his cricket skills. His father, Dr Mpho Rabada, is a neurosurgeon.Chappell's comment was met with ire on social media, but shockingly, his employers Channel 9 had offered no apology late last night.A Twitter user, @FlutterbysRFree, posted a picture of Joburg and wrote: "This is the 'village' in SA that KG comes from. #IanChappell shove your racist comment where you think the sun shines."@Ayubsayed said: "Maybe our villager's dad can work on your brain."?@bernardgwhisky wrote: "Ah, #IanChappell, it takes a village, Dad neurosurgeon &amp; Mom lawyer to raise a child."Another called for Chappell to be sacked for his "disgusting racism".
