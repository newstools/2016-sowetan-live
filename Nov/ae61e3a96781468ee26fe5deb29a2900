Parliament s joint standing committee on intelligence has recommended that Prof Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe head of Unisa s department of police practice be appointed the country s new inspector-general of intelligence.The inspector-general of intelligence is the official who must see to it that the country s intelligence services including its spies act within the confines of the law.The position has been vacant for almost 18 months since the term of the previous incumbent Advocate Faith Radebe ended on March 31 2015.Part of the hold-up was caused by the fact that the ANC majority in the committee previously wanted its former MP Cecil Burgess to fill the position.However because of the fact that the inspector-general must be endorsed by two thirds of the members of the National Assembly the ANC needed the support of opposition parties.The National Assembly is expected to endorse Dintwe s appointment allowing President Jacob Zuma to make the appointment.Before becoming an academic Dintwe was a senior member of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) in Mpumalanga.He holds a doctorate in police practice.In reaction the Right2Know campaign which has put much pressure on parliament to appoint the IGI was lukewarm about Dintwe s appointment. We have seen the picture in circulation of the candidate with Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe. It would be up to the candidate to explain the nature of that relationship said R2K spokesman Murray Hunter with reference to the profile picture on Dintwe s Facebook page. Having a certain political affiliation doesn t necessarily mean a candidate is unsuitable but it would be seriously concerning if a political affiliation was not disclosed to Parliament and to the public. The incoming inspector general must take on a huge backlog of investigations many of which could be politically explosive and which will test the independence of the office. You can be sure that we intend to use this office. Our members have been harassed by intelligence officials and witnessed serious abuses of power. If there s an Inspector General they can expect us at their office on day one Hunter promised.
