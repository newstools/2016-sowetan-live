There are many coaches who would kill to be in the shoes of Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane right now.Mosimane will have reigning PSL footballer of the season Khama Billiat back for Sundowns' Absa Premiership at Ajax Cape Town tomorrow.The Brazilians have scored nine goals in Billiat's absence, so you can imagine how much more of a threat the league champions will be when the Zimbabwean gets back into the team to join in-form players Sibusiso Vilakazi, Percy Tau and Anthony Laffor in attack.Keagan Dolly also looks set to return to the line-up after sitting on the bench in Sundowns' 5-0 victory over Highlands Park at Loftus on Sunday."I think Khama should be back on Wednesday, so we will have the numbers back. Keagan should also be back, but we've lost two players now - [Tebogo] Langerman and Ricardo [Nascimento]," said Mosimane."Cape Town is forever difficult for us. We drew there last year. We are playing them [Ajax] at the wrong time because they just won [their first game of the season] in Rustenburg [against Platinum Stars last Tuesday]. They are motivated and they are always up for it when they play against us."Sundowns tore the Highlands defence apart on Sunday, playing with the guile that should have rivals shaking in the boots.It was Downs' fourth win on the trot. They are now just seven points behind log leaders Bidvest Wits."We are happy we scored five goals. I thought we would score more in the second half, but we could not break their wall."It was important for us to save our energy [for tomorrow], that's why we were sitting a bit on the ball," said Mosimane.Defender Anele Ngcongca, meanwhile, looks set to miss the Fifa Club World Cup. Signed during the last transfer window, Ngcongca recently returned to light training after recovering from a knee injury, but he's unlikely to be fit for the competition in Japan next month."Anele is running now. His recovery is very good, but when you look at the days [left to the Club World], I don't know if he will make it."
