Mbuvi Ngunze remains CEO."Based on the progress on specific issues raised by Kalpa, we are confident that these developments will have a positive impact on the airline's recovery efforts," the union said in a statement.Partly owned by Air France KLM, Kenya Airways sank into loss four years ago after tourism slumped following attacks by militants from the Somalia-based al Shabaab Islamist group.It has been selling assets and seeking fresh funds to dig itself out of its losses.
