Although Banyana Banyana face the risk of being eliminated from the CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations, caretaker coach Desiree Ellis refuses to concede defeat.Banyana must beat Egypt tomorrow in a make-or-break tie to reach the semifinals.SA will need a huge favour from Cameroon to hold off Zimbabwe in the final Group A match."We have one game left and we have to do the best we can. That is now our final. We were in a similar position in 2014. We can sneak in," Ellis said.Banyana were in a similar position in Namibia two years ago. Playing in Group B at the time, they lost 1-0 to Cameroon in their opening match and drew 1-1 against Ghana in their next encounter.They then needed to beat Algeria to at least finish second and reach the semis, a miracle they pulled off with a 5-1 beating of the North Africans. And with Ghana beating Cameroon 1-0 in the other clash, Banyana advanced on goal difference.It could also come down to goal difference if SA beat Egypt and Zimbabwe overcome Cameroon in tomorrow's matches.If Banyana are knocked out, it will be the third time in the history of the tournament that they exit in the group stages after doing so in 1998 and 2004.If they go through to the semis as Group A runners-up, they are likely to face the defending champions Nigeria who look set to win Group B.In the other semi clash, the hosts Cameroon, as Group A winners, are likely to face Group B runners-up and that is Ghana at this stage.
