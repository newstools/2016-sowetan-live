Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should take over before President Jacob Zuma s term of office comes to an end says #FeesMustFall leader Mcebo Dlamini. Zuma has played his part. The deputy president must take over until 2019 and lead us to the next elections so that he can boost investor confidence so that he can boost the confidence of business and the confidence of the elite the student leader said in an exclusive interview with TMG Digital. He speaks to the elite and we have reached that stage I m happy that we know he s not a Donald Trump. America have their own problems that they must deal with and we have our own problems. So Cyril must take over. Ramaphosa however had a task ahead of him if he wanted to lead the youth. He has his own problems and he is not coming into that chair with clean hands. I am waiting for a Cyril Ramaphosa that will take the likes of young people and go to Marikana and apologise not that he did anything [wrong] in Marikana but because Marikana happened and his name featured there he must just apologise said Dlamini. [Apologising] is not an admission of guilt; [it] is being conscious and that s being an African. Elaborating on this Dlamini made an analogy of a dog biting a neighbour s chicken and it was the dog s owner who would need to apologise.Police shot and killed 34 strikers at a Lonmin mine in Marikana in August 2012. Ramaphosa was a non-executive member of the Lonmin board and a shareholder at the time before becoming deputy president.In his emails to other Lonmin board members he signalled he wanted greater action on ending the Marikana stand-off and said that there were dastardly criminals present.Ramaphosa denied accusations that he pressed for a police crackdown and a judicial commission of inquiry cleared him of responsibility for the massacre.
