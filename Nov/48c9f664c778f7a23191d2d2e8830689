Denis Onyango s head injury picked up in the African Champions League final last month has ruled him out of this Saturday s World Cup qualifier for Uganda.The Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper suffered a concussion after colliding with Zamalek s Stanley Ohawuchi in the opening exchanges of the final in Alexandria last month and has not played for the newly crowned continental champions since.He did travel to Uganda this week in the hopes of turning out for his national team.But Ugandan doctors have confirmed the diagnosis he received at Sundowns and ruled him out for the home match against Congo in Kampala.In terms of FIFA rules national associations have the right to summon a player even if his club say he is injured so that he can be examined by national team medical staff in order to double check the club s diagnosis. We can t risk playing him when the doctors are ordering him to rest said Uganda coach Milutin Srejedovich on Thursday. Between having him for Congo or the Nations Cup finals I would always choose the Nations Cup. He will be missed but no match is more important than Denis career and life. Onyango will stay on in Kampala for Saturday s qualifier to offer moral support and on Thursday went to lunch at State House in Entebbe along with the rest of the squad where they were hosted by President Yoweri Museveni.The 29-year-old Onyango has had a dream year with success in the Champions League and helping Uganda qualify for the 2017 Nations Cup finals for the first time in almost 40 years.On top of that he kept a clean sheet last month when Uganda began the group phase of the World Cup qualifiers with a shock draw away in Ghana in Group E. - TMG Digital
