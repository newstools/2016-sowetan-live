Steve Komphela's mission to prove he is the right man for the coaching job at Kaizer Chiefs will not get any easier as he prepares to welcome a team that has already beaten him this season.Cape Town City stunned Chiefs in the MTN8 quarterfinals earlier this season, defeating them 1-0 at Cape Town Stadium to pile the pressure on Komphela in only the newly-established club's second match of the campaign.City have become even stronger since, particularly in attack where they are scoring freely.In November alone, the "Citizens" have scored 14 goals in five matches, including putting four past both Baroka and Free State Stars on their way to reaching the Telkom Knockout final.Having conceded four goals in their last two matches, Amakhosi need a solid plan to stop the threat posed by City in the attacking half of the field when they face-off at FNB Stadium tonight (7.30pm)."Their confidence levels are very high. They are lethal on counter attack. When they come they come very fast, which is one thing we need to acknowledge," said Komphela."[City coach] Eric Tinkler has a lot of variations on set pieces. They have a number of good players who need to be respected. With us we are not at the right levels of confidence, but it's not excuse. We still need to go face a team that has the right levels of confidence."The attendance at FNB Stadium has been poor and it could get worse if Chiefs continue their slump.Amakhosi have managed just two victories in five home matches, two of which have been played at Moses Mabhida Stadium."All you need to do is perform and your performances will invite people. We hope they come. Ours is just to perform," said Komphela, who will be without injured William Twala and possibly Sibusiso Khumalo as well.Meanwhile, former Chiefs defender Siboniso Gaxa signed for log leaders Bidvest Wits yesterday, the club announced.Gaxa, however, is still in a contract dispute with Amakhosi. He took the club to the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber after he was released as a free agent at the end of last season, but he is adamant his contract was extended halfway through the campaign and is seeking compensation.l See Page 26
