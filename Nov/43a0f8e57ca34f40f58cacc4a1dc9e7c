That Thela Ngobeni has featured in just 12 games in close to a decade as a professional is a subject he says is not worth entertaining.Instead, Ngobeni insisted over the weekend that he was focused on the future when pressed about his slow progress.The Free State Stars goalkeeper, who is on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns, was at his best when Stars reached the Telkom Knockout semis at the expense of Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday.Not only did Ngobeni make some fantastic saves in regulation time against his former club, but he also went on to save two penalties as Ea Lla Koto won 6-5 during the dramatic shoot-out.The match had ended 2-2 after 120 minutes.The 27-year-old has had little to celebrate over the years since he made his PSL debut in Chiefs colours back in August 2009 against SuperSport United, which Chiefs lost 1-0 at Lucas Moripe Stadium."I think that's a good question but it is also important for me not to live in the past. I see a great career ahead of me and I think I just need to focus and do well," he said. "I can only improve and get better," said Ngobeni, who has kept two clean sheets this season.After making his debut for Chiefs seven years ago, Ngobeni was injured and did not play another official match for the club until his departure in 2012.He joined Sundowns at the beginning of 2013, but has rarely featured for the Brazilians with just two appearances to his name.On loan at Stars, the Katlehong-born goalkeeper is finally getting a regular run and has started nine out of their 10 games this season.Naturally, Ngobeni has expressed delight in how things are working out for him and was pleased with his performance against Chiefs."At the end of the day, penalties can go either way and the team did very well. My teammates took very good penalties and I was also fortunate to save two penalties. I'm happy for myself, the team and the coach," he added.Stars will play Cape Town City away from home in the semis, but the dates and venues are yet to be confirmed.
