Unlike previous occasions when Steve Komphela's bosses at Kaizer Chiefs declared their unequivocal support of their under-performing coach, the club backed out of commenting about the mounting pressure on their man in the hot seat.Chiefs manager Bobby Motaung refused to comment yesterday despite Amakhosi's latest slump where they have gone four matches without a win in all competitions.Sowetan has previously published interviews of club management backing Komphela, but there was none of that when Motaung was contacted yesterday."We are focused on the game against SuperSport [United], so I am not going to comment. What is in the past is in past," Motaung told Sowetan when asked about the recent results and pressure on the coach.Chiefs host SuperSport United at FNB Stadium in the Absa Premiership tomorrow where only a win will ease the pressure on Komphela, who is still reeling for a 2-1 defeat at Mamelodi Sundowns at the weekend. Chiefs have not won a league match since they beat Ajax Cape Town on October 15.In between, Amakhosi drew against Orlando Pirates and Baroka - both goalless - and got eliminated by Free State Stars in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal a fortnight ago.During this period Chiefs surrendered top spot and have since dropped to fifth on the log.Komphela has persisted with the 3-4-3 formation that has been a big topic in recent days. The pattern has sacrificed George Lebese, despite the midfielder playing a vital role in the games that shot Chiefs to the top not too long ago.Lebese was an unused substitute for a second consecutive game in Amakhosi's defeat at Loftus Stadium on Saturday.In a game where Chiefs hardly threatened the Sundowns defence, Lebese could have made a difference with his creativity going forward.In the 3-4-3 system - which has been used in Amakhosi's last two matches - Ramahlwe Mphahlele and Sibusiso Khumalo are used as wing backs to cover ground both in defence and attack. "It's the change of formation from the coach. He had to sacrifice one midfielder, which is me," said Lebese yesterday."Our wing backs tend to be wingers, so it's the decision of the coach whether he plays wingers or wing backs. He has been playing wing backs, so that's why the wingers have not been playing. So hopefully I will get a chance to play again."SuperSport dropped points against Baroka at the weekend as the match at Peter Mokaba Stadium finished 1-1.FIXTURES (all 7.30pm)TOMORROWPlat Stars v Ajax, Royal BafokengCPT City v Maritzburg Utd, Athlone StadiumWEDNESDAYChiefs v SuperSport, FNBSundowns v Arrows, LoftusCeltic v Baroka, Dr Molemela StadiumWits v Highlands, Bidvest StadiumPolokwane v FS Stars, New Peter Mokaba Stadium
