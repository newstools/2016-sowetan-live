The Women's Africa Cup of Nations tournaments have often proved hard to sell to the fans, but the ongoing event in Cameroon is proving otherwise.The opening dayof the event attracted a capacity crowd of 35000 and the number was 30 000 on Tuesday.Amongst the spectators on day one was the country's president Paul Biya, who apparently spends most of his time in France but returned for the opening ceremony. Legendary striker Samuel Eto'o, also graced the occasion.Security was very tight on day one and word on the streets was that was because the president was present.As a result, many were forced to watch the match on TV across the road from the stadium because once Biya was inside the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium - named after the country's first president who was succeeded by Biya in 1982 - no one was allowed in.Some even hinted that there were probably a lot of fake tickets floating around because only 35000 had been printe for the opening.Janvier Njikam, sports editor of local newspaper Frontieres D'Afrique, says the excitement will not die down."People love football here and it doesn't matter if it is men or women playing. Of course, you are not going to see that big crowd again until at least the final," Njikam said.It helps that the tickets here are going for as little as 1000 Central African Francs (CAF) - about R23.This is close to nothing because big matches here involving top clubs like Cotonsport can set you back 5000 francs (R117), according to a local, Jean Richard, who is the assistant manager at the CAF accreditation centre.Two years ago, the tournament staged in Namibia played before virtually empty stands even in matches involving the hosts.Here, small businesses are also booming, selling anything from soft drinks, peanuts and corn.Most Cameroonians say the tournament is an opportunity to showcase the country's capacity as a tourist destination, rather than a nation living in fear of Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist militant group.The visitors, though, are experiencing a different country, where people are welcoming and lend a helping hand at every opportunity.Cameroon will also host the men's Africa Cup of Nations in 2019.IN NUMBERS1 - SA referee Akhona Makalima is among the 24 match officials177 - The number of players that have been registered for the tournament9 - Nigeria has nine titles1000 - Ordinary match tickets cost a thousand francs (about R23) lMabasa is in Cameroon courtesy of Sasol
