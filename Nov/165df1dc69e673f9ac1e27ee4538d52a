Eskom denied that Gupta-linked firm Trillian handled negotiations for Eskom to settle a massive insurance claim.A report in the Mail &amp; Guardian on Friday said Trillian Capital Partners and its associated company Trillian Advisory negotiated with Eskom s insurers for months in an attempt to settle a R5-billion claim related to the March 2014 explosion at the Duvha power plant in Mpumalanga.The newspaper said documents show that Trillian executives met representatives of the insurers Marsh in Sandton; that Trillian represented itself as Eskom s agent in the matter; and that Eskom bosses knew of its work through a steering committee which included Eskom executives.The report said according to the document it had seen Trillian executives also worked to find a supplier to replace the Duvha boiler a process scheduled to start next year which Trillian had been appointed to do.In a statement Eskom said Trillian did not provide any assistance with negotiations for Eskom s Duvha insurance claim. We would like to state categorically that Eskom has no contracts in place with Trillian Capital Partners and/or associated companies. Eskom said when the current Eskom board was appointed in December 2014 Eskom was facing challenges at both an operational and financial levels.It said this period saw capacity constraints delays in the new build programme and the associated cost overruns and load shedding. These challenges led to the board initiating an investigation into the reasons for the above issues and to also devise a turnaround strategy for the organisation. Pursuant to this in June 2015 the Board gave the mandate to negotiate a risk-based contract with McKinsey covering the main risk areas of the turnaround strategy. Eskom also said it also appointed a number of providers to mitigate against the risks faced by Eskom at the time. These included imminent credit rating reviews by ratings agencies. These service providers included Deloitte Consulting Barclays McKinsey Citibank and Trillian. It is the second time in a month that the power utility dnied links with Trillian Capital Partners and/or associated companies .At the end of October it issued a similar statement after the company was fingered in a whistleblower s affidavit contained in former public protector Thuli Madonsela state capture report that said Trillian knew of the axing of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene two months before it happened.At the time Trillian s independent non-executive chairman Tokyo Sexwale said that he had launched an independent investigation to test the veracity of allegations that people within Trillian Capital Partners knew of Nene s firing.
