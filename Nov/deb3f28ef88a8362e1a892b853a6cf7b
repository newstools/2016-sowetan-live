The principal who was stabbed 30 times by an expelled teacher at a primary school in Soweto recently underwent a procedure to drain blood from her lungs.This was revealed by Nothemba Lebepe's husband, Godfrey, yesterday outside the Lenasia Magistrate's Court where Oria Molapo made a second appearance.Molapo, 42, is facing charges of attempted murder and malicious damage to property after he allegedly smashed the window of Lebepe's car with a hammer and stabbed her at Paul Mosaka Primary School in Pimville, Soweto, last Monday.This was about six hours after he had allegedly sent Lebepe an SMS threatening to put her in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.Lebepe's family said she and Molapo had been in conflict for more than 10 years. This centered around his alleged fake qualifications. Molapo was dismissed last year for this reason.Godfrey told Sowetan that his wife was recovering even though she was still in ICU."I hope that she is out of danger after this procedure. It has been difficult. The kids are busy with exams and I'm trying to make things as normal as possible and taking each day as it comes," he said.Molapo's bail application was postponed to next month because the state said it wanted to add more charges. His lawyer said they would rather wait until the charges were added before continuing with the bail application.Court 3 was packed with Sadtu members who came to support the Lebepe family. When Molapo was led down to the cells after his case was postponed, some people in the gallery swore at him.Outside court, the group of Sadtu members, mostly women, held up placards that read "No bail for Paul Mosaka monster", "Molapo must pay for his crime" and "No violence against educators".Addressing the small crowd, Sadtu provincial secretary Tseliso Ledimo said the union's members were sending a strong message that criminals belonged in jail and not in schools."No amount of grieving or dissatisfaction can justify this criminal act, he belongs in jail," Ledimo said.macupeb@sowetan.co.za
