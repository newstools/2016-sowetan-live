Donald Trump said Wednesday he would bind the nation s deep wounds and be a president for all Americans, as he praised his defeated rival Hillary Clinton for her years of public service. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country, Trump said during his speech acknowledging a stunning victory in the White House race. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans.
