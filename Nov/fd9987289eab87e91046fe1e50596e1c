The Department of Energy s briefing on the nuclear build programme to Parliament s energy portfolio committee will be a closed meeting with no media or members of the public present committee chairman Fikile Majola announced on Tuesday.The decision marks a step backwards in Majola s otherwise forthright push for greater transparency from the department which has been intent on withholding documents on the nuclear procurement programme.The sitting was yet to be scheduled.Majola also said the meeting to discuss the forensic reports into the R14.5-billion impairment suffered by PetroSA on its investment in the Ikhwezi offshore drilling project was also to be closed. This meeting was also scheduled for Tuesday attracting a strong media presence.Journalists and other members of the public were required to leave the room.Majola said he had obtained the necessary authorisation from parliamentary authorities to close the meeting which would be addressed by the PetroSA board.At a previous sitting Majola obtained copies of the forensic reports into the Ikhwezi project on the proviso that the committee decided in what manner it dealt with it giving consideration to the need for confidentiality.The Ikhwezi project was intended to bolster the supply of gas to PetroSA s gas-to-fuel refinery at Mossel Bay but generated only about 10% of the envisaged volumes.
