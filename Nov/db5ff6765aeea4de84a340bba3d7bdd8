Dam levels have improved since the recent rainfalls in some parts of the country but water restrictions are far from being lifted the Department of Water and Sanitation said on Thursday. The water restrictions still remain in place. Particular municipalities will take decisions on their lifting as per the savings that will be seen through this process as well as how quickly our water sources might recover. This might differ from place to place and the timing thereof just like for their imposition will be dependent on particular circumstances as experienced by individual municipalities and provinces said water and sanitation department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau.The City of Johannesburg s water department on Thursday said level two restrictions are still in place and must be adhered to. Level-2 water restrictions according to section 44 (3) of the Water Services Bylaw states that all consumers are forthwith compelled not to water and irrigate their gardens from 06:00 and 18:00 everyday; only hand held hosepipes or bucket/watering cans are allowed outside these hours said Joburg water spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene.She said residents are required to not fill their swimming pools with municipal water and not to use hosepipes to wash their cars paved areas etc.
