Sunday World readers woke up to a brand new looking paper last week.The new design is fresh, cheeky and edgy and has created quite a buzz on social media.Editor Abdul Milazi said the redesign was as a result of readers demanding a more cooler product that was in tune with the times. Our loyal readers wanted a paper that was modern, cool but still captured the essence of Kasi life. So we came up with a newspaper that is unusual and original but not wholly unfamiliar in terms of content, said Milazi.He said the aim was to take elements that readers really loved and find better ways of packaging and presenting them. The paper has a heritage and culture that our readers enjoy and love. Our challenge was to come up with something that is fresh, cheekier and new but at the same time celebrate and leverage the paper s history, Milazi said.The new look is a complete departure from the old community newspaper feel. I believe we have captured what our readers wanted. If it were a person, the new look Sunday World would be a streetsmart Kasi woman who is comfortable in All Stars but can also rock stilettos like Bonang Matheba. It's the best of both worlds, said Milazi.
