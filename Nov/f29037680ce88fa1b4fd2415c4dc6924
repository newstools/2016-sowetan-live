Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo has admitted that there is a room for improvement in their play despite Saturday's hard-fought victory over Senegal.The reality is that Bafana have struggled to protect leads in the last few matches including their first match of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Burkina Faso last month, which ended 1-1 when Bafana conceded in injury time.Against Senegal at the weekend, Bafana led 2-0 going into the break, but the match could easily have ended in a draw with coach Shakes Mashaba's team defending too deep, resulting in the Lions of Teranga pulling one back and a few heart-stopping moments in second half."Obviously, for the last two games it's been difficult to protect our lead and we do speak as players that we need to push up, because the more we are trying to protect the lead, the more we invite pressure to ourselves."I think what we couldn't do right is that we didn't press the ball and we were forced to retreat," reflected the skipper, who scored a penalty against Senegal which was his first international goal.Hlatshwayo, though, commended the players for their overall effort, saying the team did well under the circumstances."We knew who we were up against and we know Senegal because we have played them before," he said.
