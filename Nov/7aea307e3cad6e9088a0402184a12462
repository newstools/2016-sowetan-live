The acts of intimidation directed at the SABC 8 if left unattended may spiral out of hand and result in the loss of innocent lives the ad hoc committee on the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board inquiry said. Following our inaugural meeting we have written a letter to the Minister of Police Nkosinathi Nhleko requesting that he investigate and advise on what kind of protection is available to those journalists and all other potential witnesses that are to appear before the ad hoc committee who may be targeted committee chair Vincent Smith said on Thursday. We are of the firm view that any kind of intimidation cannot be tolerated and that those responsible should face the consequences of their actions. We reiterated our confidence in the SAPS and believe that in light of the seriousness of the allegations they will give urgent attention to the matter. A statement said the committee further believes that any kind of intimidation is against the spirit of whistle blowing which is about exposing maladministration and corruption in government departments and entities .According to media reports the eight outspoken journalists are living in fear following a series of sinister incidents and death threats aimed at forcing them to drop their court action against the public broadcaster.In September the SABC 8 advised the Constitutional Court that they intend persisting with their court action because a culture of censorship and fear in the SABC s newsrooms persists despite their reinstatement after being suspended for speaking up against alleged censorship by the public broadcaster.The ad hoc committee which met for the first time on Tuesday was formed by the National Assembly after the SABC board members objected to the portfolio committee on communications holding the probe citing prejudice as the main reason and requested that another committee be appointed to carry out the inquiry .The committee had more than a month ago agreed to hold an inquiry into the SABC board after it quizzed the board on controversial executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng s new appointment as group executive for corporate affairs following the Supreme Court of Appeal s dismissal of his challenge to a judgment which ruled that his earlier appointment as chief operating officer was unlawful.The inquiry will start on November 29 and could continue its work through the December parliamentary break.It also emerged on Thursday that Motsoeneng was being sued by African National Congress chief whip Jackson Mthembu for R1-million for making malicious and defamatory allegations against him.Mthembu s office said on Thursday that Motsoeneng during a live broadcast of a New Age business briefing on October 27 had made outrageous claims and veiled threats against the Chief Whip warning him to desist from making a lot of noise regarding the SABC and alleging his interest was driven by ulterior motives .Motsoeneng further alleged that Mthembu had attempted to capture him.Mthembu s lawyers sent a letter to Motsoeneng at the start of November demanding an immediate public apology and retraction of his defamatory claims . Having failed to do so within the stipulated period legal proceedings have now been lodged with the court and Mr Motsoeneng will be served with the papers in the next few days Mthembu s office said.
