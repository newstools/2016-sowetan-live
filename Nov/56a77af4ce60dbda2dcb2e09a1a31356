Eric Kapia Mukadi's winning run will come to a screeching end on Thursday night, warns Thulani "Tulz" Mbenge.Mukadi, 24, from Kinshasa, DR Congo, has 17 wins and a draw since he turned professional in 2010.He will oppose Mbenge, 25, for a vacant ABU welterweight belt.Their bout between the dreadlocked warriors will headline the Christmas Cracker bill of veteran promoter Jeff Ellis, whose African Ring will stage its annual series at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park.Mbenge, who turned professional last year, warned: "He's had it all well but that has come to and end. I don't know Eric and actually, I don't care. All I am interested in is me winning the ABU title.""I do no do research about my opponents or get videos of their fights. I train hard and perfect my craft," added Mbenge, who is trained in Johannesburg by Sean Smith.The 2012 Olympian said looking at Mukadi's poor knockout ratio, he is convinced that the Congolese is no banger."He is not someone to worry much about," said the hot prospect from Mdantsane, who attributed his success to undivided attention to the fistic sport."I am always in camp because boxing is my life. I do not want to be caught off guard, we sometimes get fights at short notice, so I have to stay ready for action. I have been in the gym since my last fight in July."Diners will see the return in action of Johnny "The Hurricane" Muller who last fought in June when he was defeated by Micki Nielsen over 10 rounds.Muller will face Herman Potgieter over eight rounds.There will be five more bouts, and action will begin at 7pm.
