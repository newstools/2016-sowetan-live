Maritzburg United begin what could be a fruitful few days in Cape Town this weekend but must overcome a horrorific record that has seen them only ever win one league match in the Mother City.United take on Ajax Cape Town on Saturday before a meeting with new Premier Soccer League franchise Cape Town City next Tuesday. Both games will be played at Cape Town Stadium and present Maritzburg with the opportunity of moving out of the bottom half of the table if they can bag a couple of wins. That will mean they need to go against history though. This will be the first time they face City but United have never won a league clash at Ajax Santos or Vasco da Gama three of the other Cape Town sides they have met in the PSL. Their only success in Cape Town came in a 1-0 win at Chippa United in 2012 when the Chilli Boyz were located in the Mother City. They later moved their base to Port Elizabeth. It is a horror run for the Maritzburg club who are currently winless in their last eight games piling on the pressure for coach Ernst Middendorp. They have travelled to Ajax on 10 previous occasions and lost five of those coming away with five draws. One of those was on the final day of the season in 2010-11 when a 2-2 scoreline saw Ajax gift the league championship title to Orlando Pirates. Ajax won this fixture 3-1 last season as a brace from Prince Nxumalo and a late Nathan Paulse goal gave the Urban Warriors the win. United s only victory in Cape Town four years ago came during Middendorp s first spell in charge when a goal from Philani Zulu currently on the sidelines at the club due to a contractual dispute scored in the first half against Chippa. United have been fair travellers to other destinations down the years though and most recently have performed reasonably well on the road. Their last six away games in the league have yielded three wins two draws and a single defeat which came at Kaizer Chiefs earlier in this campaign in controversial fashion. - TMG Sport
