Never, ever neglect your responsibilities. With these words, Bafana Bafana midfielder Daine Klate has shared the secret of how he made it to the top and hopes the younger players can follow his example.From a distance, the 31-year-old is leading a near-perfect life and could back that up by pointing to a successful career that includes five league titles, eight cups and 14 senior national caps after his substitute appearance in the 2-1 win over Senegal at the weekend.The Bidvest Wits winger said he is far from perfect."I do some wrong things at times, but if you take care of your priorities the way you should, you just learn from what happens in between. Never, ever neglect your priorities," Klate told Sowetan in Polokwane from the Bafana camp.His upbringing was a disciplined one and even when he steps out of line, he is quick to come back to his senses owing to the way he was raised."I believe my school career was good, because I never neglected my school work and I think that's where as a soccer player, as a human being, I learnt my life skills," said Klate, who matriculated in 2002 and is a School of Excellence graduate."I have never, ever missed a training session, where I'm supposed to be there and no one knows where I am. There have been times when I have gone out [at night] and there was training on a Sunday, but I would be there on time."So I'm not saying I'm perfect and I don't do the wrong things at times. Yes, I do them, but my priorities will never be neglected, which is my job. I'm not going to do things and after that I must apologise."He added: "My life revolves around being disciplined."Klate is part of the Bafana Bafana team that will face Mozambique in a friendly encounter in Maputo tonight (7pm).
