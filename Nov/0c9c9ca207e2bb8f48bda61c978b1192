The vote of no confidence in president Jacob Zuma has no chance of succeeding the African National Congress (ANC) said on Tuesday.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said calls for president Jacob Zuma to resign were premature and unfounded .He said the vote of no confidence the Democratic Alliance was planning to call for in parliament was an annual frivolous ritual that is fast losing its meaning. The discussion of the vote of no confidence has no chance of succeeding Mantashe said.He told the media that the party s National Working Committee (NWC) had met on Monday to discuss among other issues the state capture report funding for higher education and the parliamentary motion of no confidence against Zuma.The meeting he said was scheduled and not out of the ordinary.The recommendations made by the office of the public protector s office in the state capture report were inconclusive Mantashe said. The ANC is of the view that the recommendations are inconclusive and contain no guilty finding on any party. Mantashe said the party supports the setting up of a judicial commission of inquiry as recommended by the public protector. TMG Digital
