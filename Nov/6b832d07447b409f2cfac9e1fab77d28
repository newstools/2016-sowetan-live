To the fans I'd like to say a special thanks for always making me proud to represent you guys while representing the Proteas and our wonderful country. I'd like to thank my agent Arthur Turner for all his support too. Lastly I d like to mention my family for their unwavering support and love shown throughout my career and introducing me to a game I'll continue to love forever.
