Olympic champion Wayde van Niekerk could be running towards another off-track podium clean sweep in the coming days.This after the 24-year-old sprinter was voted the Best Male Athlete of the Rio 2016 by the Association of National Olympic Committees (Anoc) at a gala awards ceremony in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday night.The award - a first by a South African athlete - is likely to influence Van Niekerk's candidature at the SA Sport and IAAF awards in the next fortnight.Anoc is the umbrella organisation of the world's national Olympic committees that is recognised by the International Olympic Committee.Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula and Athletics SA (ASA) were among the first to congratulate the sprinter, whose 43.03 seconds Rio Olympic triumph shattered legendary US sprinter Michael Johnson's 17-year-old world record over the one-lap event."Wayde has over a short period of time emerged as one of the greatest athletes of this generation and the world is acknowledging that. This award is a first for a South African, which further affirms Wayde as a living inspiration for our young people," Mbalula said in a statement yesterday. ASA president Aleck Skhosana said: "This award is a tremendous honour for Wayde, which once again shows that he has established his place among the top athletes in the world."With his latest achievement, it is somewhat clear that the feat will sway votes in Van Niekerk's favour going to the SA Sport and IAAF awards.He has been nominated in the SA Sportsman, Sport Star and the People's Choice categories at the national sport awards in Bloemfontein on November 27. The Bloemfontein-based sprinter is also in the running for the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award in Monaco, France, in December 2.At the SA Sport awards, Van Niekerk will contest the main awards with fellow Rio Games gold medallist Caster Semenya, champion swimmer Chad le Clos, rising cricketer Kagiso Rabada and Sevens Rugby star Seabelo Senatla. In Monaco, the multiple SA 400m champ will size up Jamaican sprint king Usain Bolt and mid-distance champion Mo Farah of Great Britain for the IAAF big prize.
