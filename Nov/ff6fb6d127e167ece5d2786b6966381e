The idea of finishing the race inside the FNB Stadium spurred Sintayehu Yinesu on to a hat-trick of Soweto Marathon wins - and Ethiopia's clean sweep - at yesterday's race.Speaking after collecting his third crown in a row and the R220000 cash prize in a time of 2:20:44, Yinesu said he was not even sure that he would be the first across the line as he had just recovered from a hamstring injury."I was happy when I heard that the race will finish at the stadium. The Ethiopians know the stadium very well back home because it hosted the World Cup final [in 2010]," said the runner who turns 26 next month.Abere Alebachew claimed the women's title in 2:42:32, ahead of compatriot Chelitu Bogale Asefa in 2:45:22.Edward Mothibi (2:25:33 in 7th) and Irvette van Zyl (2:46:32 in 3rd) where the first locals home in a hotly contested top 10 dominated by Ethiopia and Lesotho.A heat wave was expected to wreck havoc but race day temperatures started at around 17 C and rose to 22 in the second half to make for near-perfect weather for the runners.There was no clear favourite after the halfway mark as there were more than 10 men in the chase in the main race.However, Yinesu broke away with less than 10km to go, leaving Lesotho's Tshepo Mathibelle and his compatriot Seutloali Khoarahlane in his wake.Mathibelle came second in 2:21:46, while Khoarahlane finished third in 2:23:22.In the women's race, Alebachew and Asefa had it easy after the favourite Van Zyl dropped off the pace with 20km to go.The results of the main race made disappointing reading for SA fans as the wait for a local winner was stretched to five years . Michael Mazibuko was the last South African man to clinch the event in 2011, while Rene Kalmer brought the women's crown home in 2009 .While the elite runners commended the organisers for a well-organised event, complete road closures is something the organisers could consider in future after a minor traffic incident slowed the runners down in Orlando.About 25 000 runners lined up at the start at FNB Stadium across the 42km, 21km and 10km races.l David Manja and Joel Mohau handed SA a one-two finish in the half marathon, while Onneile Dintwe of Botswana won the women's race ahead of SA runners Lebogang Phalula and Christine Kalmer.Locals Namakoe Nkasi and Chery-Lee Schoeman won the 10km.
