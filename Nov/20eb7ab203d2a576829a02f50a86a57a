Banyana Banyana's dismal record against Nigeria in the CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations leaves one hopeless ahead of tomorrow's semifinal clash in Limbe (8pm).Despite this, the Banyana camp has promised to turn the tables around on their long-standing rivals.The "Super Falcons", who are the defending champions with nine titles to their name, head into the encounter confident.This because the west Africans have beaten SA eight times in previous meetings in the continental tournament, including twice in the final.Banyana have one win to show for their efforts, which came in the semifinals four years ago in Equatorial Guinea.Perhaps Banyana can cause another upset tomorrow.Meanwhile, hosts Cameroon will face Ghana in the other semifinal in Yaounde, also tomorrow (5pm).Head to head1995 (final played over two legs)Nigeria 4-1 SASA 1-7 NigeriaNigeria won 11-2 on aggregate2000 (final)SA 0-2 NigeriaThe match was abandoned after 75 minutes and Nigeria declared champions due to fans rioting at Vosloorus Stadium.2002 (semifinals)Nigeria 5-0 SA2006 (group stage)Nigeria 2-0 SA2008 (group stage)SA 0-1 Nigeria2010 (group stage)SA 1-2 Nigeria2012 (semifinals)SA 1-0 Nigeria2014 (semifinals)Nigeria 2-1 SA.
