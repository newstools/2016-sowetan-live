A 21-year-old University of Johannesburg (UJ) student who was shot and killed at a private residence at the weekend will be buried on Sunday in Mozambique.Kelvin Baloyi was shot, allegedly by a security guard, in the early hours of Saturday morning at The Yards private residence on Rissik Street after guards demanded that students end a party.He was doing his first-year BSc in computer science and informatics.Busisiwe Maphumulo, Baloyi's previous landlady in Bekkersdal on the West Rand, told Sowetan that his body will leave the country early tomorrow and the funeral will be on Sunday morning.Before Baloyi went to university he rented a backyard room with his father, a mineworker, at Maphumulo's home. She said the grieving father collected Baloyi's belongings at The Yards on Wednesday.Meanwhile, a small group of UJ students marched in Auckland Park yesterday with intentions to deliver a memorandum to the university's outgoing vice-chancellor, Professor Ihron Rensburg.The students were demanding, among other things, that the university stop doing business with the accredited private residence. They also called for the removal of private security guards on campus.The police stop them, saying the students did not apply to march.
