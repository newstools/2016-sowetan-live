The SA Football Association is looking to fast- track the disciplinary case of suspended Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba and decide on his future as soon as possible.Sowetan has learnt that Safa wants to get the process done by the end of the week following his dramatic suspension after the 2-1 victory over Senegal in the 2018 World Cup qualifier on Saturday.The coach will face a DC for his outburst after the match, particularly his attitude towards Safa big bosses and the media at Peter Mokaba Stadium. In his absence, assistant coach Owen da Gama will be in charge when Bafana take on Mozambique in a friendly tonight [7pm].Although the Safa bosses declined to comment on the matter yesterday, it is believed Mashaba will be charged with ill-discipline and for bringing the association into disrepute.His position has now become untenable and the disciplinary process is just a formality, with dismissal almost certain to be recommended.Once he is charged, Sowetan has learnt Mashaba will be given three days to plead.Yesterday, at the launch of the Totalsports Safe-hub in Alexandra, Safa president Danny Jordaan refused to comment on the matter and said all questions should be directed to chief executive Dennis Mumble, who responded with "no comment" when approached. They remain tight-lipped on the matter, but it seems the writing is already on the wall for Mashaba, whose outburst was apparently triggered by a lack of support from the association as he prepared for the Senegal match.Safa, meanwhile, are said to be in favour of appointing a coach who has experience on the continent, should Mashaba be dismissed from his job.This is vital for them because they want the person to come in and help finish off the job that Mashaba started in the qualifiers.Bafana currently have four points from two matches.
