The South African Council for Educators (Sace) Act should be amended to allow the release of the names of rotten apple teachers.That s according to Sace chief executive officer Rej Brijraj speaking on the ethical conduct of teachers at a briefing in Centurion on Monday. The council is serious that the profession must rid itself of rotten apples that bring the profession into disrepute. It has now taken a decision to propose amendments to the Sace Act to publish names of educators struck off the roll. Registered teachers that have been struck from the educators roll indefinitely by Sace will not be able to teach again in South Africa or countries which have a relationship with the council Brijraj said.Sace has relationships with 15 African countries and 18 countries overseas which approach it to check the professional standing of South African teachers before employing them.Over the past two years 33 former teachers have been struck from the roll of educators by the Sace.Most of these cases are linked to sexual misconduct while others are linked to severe corporal punishment.Here are six of the 33 cases which landed teachers in hot water:- In the Free State a teacher proposed love fostered an improper love relationship and had sexual intercourse with a learner.- In Mpumalanga a teacher impregnated a learner.- In Limpopo a teacher sold drugs to learners.- In KwaZulu-Natal a teacher disrespected humiliated and assaulted a colleague.- In Limpopo a teacher severely assaulted a learner.- In Limpopo a teacher raped a learner.Brijraj said the number of complaints against teachers outstripped the number of teachers found guilty by far.He said some cases fall apart because witnesses refuse to come forward. It is our guess that parents are being bribed or threatened [to keep quiet]. He urged witnesses to speak out saying Sace would protect their identities. TMG Digital
