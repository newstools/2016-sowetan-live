Skipper Steve Smith and his Australia team are under big pressure from South Africa and their own selectors as they try to bounce back from one of their worst losing streaks in the second Test tomorrow.The Australians sunk to a comprehensive 177-run loss to the Proteas in the series opener in Perth with the team coming under heavy criticism over their capitulation.It was Australia's first loss in an opening Test of their home season in 28 years and they have now slumped to four straight defeats after crashing in all three Tests on their July-August tour of Sri Lanka."I would say every spot is under pressure," Australian coach Darren Lehmann admitted.SA, although ranked fifth in Tests to Australia's three, were bowled to victory in Perth by electric young paceman Kagiso Rabada, who stepped up when Dale Steyn broke down with a shoulder injury on the second day."I am incredibly proud of him and I have a lot of respect for anyone who puts their hands up and does the hard yards," Proteas captain Faf du Plessis said of Rabada's staunch 31-over effort in Australia's second innings.Australia, who have only lost once in 12 Tests at Hobart's Bellerive Oval, are likely to bring back Joe Burns for injured opener Marsh, while speedster Joe Mennie is expected to make his Test debut for the sidelined Siddle.SA will decide between Morne Morkel or Kyle Abbott as Steyn's replacement as the third paceman in their only likely change from Perth.
