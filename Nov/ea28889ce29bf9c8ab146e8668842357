Different week, same story for Kaizer Chiefs and their under-fire coach Steve Komphela.About a week after they were held to a 1-1 draw by SuperSport United, 10 men Amakhosi had to settle for the same score line against in-form Cape Town City, here last night.What started out as a promising night after Michelle Katsvairo gave Amakhosi a lead in the fourth minute, it became another night to forget for Komphela, who desperately needs points to turn things around and ease the mounting pressure.Sibusiso Khumalo was sent off, on his return from injury, just before the hour mark for, a challenge on Thamsanqa Mkhize. Referee Victor Gomes showed him a straight red card, although it looked harsh because his studs were not showing.Despite being a man down, Amakhosi held on to their lead until half time.In fact, they should have extended their lead had chances to George Lebese and Edmore Chirambadare not gone to waste.Unlike Chiefs who relied on counter attacking football in the second half, City played constructive football and were patiently waiting to find a chink in the Amakhosi armour. Their equaliser came eight minutes into the second period through Matt Sim, who was brought on in the first half as an extra attacking option after Khumalo was sent off.Sim also scored in City's 1-0 victory over Amakhosi in the MTN8 in September, from a deadly counter attack, but this time it was a deflected shot off that beat Itumeleng Khune.The night got worse for the hosts when Khune went off with an injury not long after City equalised.This was Amakhosi's third draw at home this season, excluding the one against Orlando Pirates because Bucs were the hosts.l Elsewhere, Bidvest Wits suffered their first defeat of the season, going 2-0 down to SuperSport United at the Mbombela Stadium.Clayton Daniels and Thabo Mnyamane were the scorers as Matsatsantsa moved to second place in the table.Maritzburg United and Chippa United drew 1-1 at Harry Gwala Stadium.
