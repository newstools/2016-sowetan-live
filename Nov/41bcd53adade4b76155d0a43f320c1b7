Due to unforeseen circumstances it is with regret that Lerato Kganyago has had to withdraw as the official host of the 2016 annual Feather Awards. The decision was made during an open discussion on Wednesday 09 November between the event organisers and Lerato herself prompted by standing career commitments. The organisers voiced their understanding in this regard reads a statement from team Lerato.Her team tells TshisaLIVE that it really is a matter of prior commitments and Lerato simply wasn t able to commit to all the rehearsals.So she ll still be at the awards but won t be hosting.No beef from any side but perhaps Lerato needs a pa to help her manage her diary so no prior commitments cause this eish again.
