Tiyani Mabunda was "very surprised" to be in the Bafana Bafana starting XI for Saturday's 2018 World Cup qualifier. But so was everyone.Few can doubt his ability considering he is now an African champion after helping Mamelodi Sundowns win the 2016 CAF Champions League.But the surprise stemmed from the fact that the 28-year-old was not named in the initial squad and only came in as a replacement for the injured Dean Furman.Even more surprising was the fact that Mabunda got the nod ahead of his teammate and Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana."I didn't expect to be in the team at all. When I got the call to come to camp, I went straight to church to thank God for the opportunity. I have played four matches for the national team before, but that was in the Chan (African Nations Championship)," Mabunda said.So while many were keeping a close eye on him as he made his senior national team debut when SA beat Senegal 2-1 at Peter Mokaba Stadium in front of his home fans, his wife Kgomotso Seehole was not watching the match and with good reason."On the day of the game, she didn't watch the game because she was at church interceding on my behalf. While I was playing, she was praying," said Mabunda, who attends the Enlightened Christian Gathering led by Major Prophet Shepherd Bushiri."It is not by my ability that I continuously perform the way I do, it is by the ability of Jesus Christ who lives in me. I am just a vessel mandated by the highest anointing, the anointing of Major 1, to demonstrate the power of Jehovah God almighty," he said.Mabunda was even happier with the way he has been accepted in the national camp and is looking forward to working his way to becoming a permanent member of the team."The whole team actually congratulated me for being able to receive the call up, for being named in the starting XI and for the performance on the day," he added.Mabunda even received plaudits from coach Shakes Mashaba."We've looked at him and he is one of the busiest players in our league and he is good when it comes to defending as well. On the day, he can give you numbers going forward," Mashaba said of Mabunda.
