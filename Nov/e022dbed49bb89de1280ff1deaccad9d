Banyana Banyana vice-captain Refiloe Jane says the team will miss the experience of Amanda Dlamini when the Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) starts in Cameroon on Saturday.But Jane has expressed confidence in the final side selected for the tournament.Dlamini, who played her 100th match for Banyana against the USA five months ago, will not be part of the Afcon squad after she told interim head coach Desiree Ellis that she had "other commitments".Midfielder Jane, who earned her 50th cap also about five months ago, will miss her combination with Dlamini."Amanda is such a great player who also has leadership qualities. We will miss her," Jane said.Banyana have been perennial "bridesmaids" because they have finished runners-up four times in the continental tournament, said Ellis, but Jane, although cautious, believes they can go one better this time."All I can say is that we are taking each game as it comes. We know that it is not going to be easy."Hopefully, we can go one better this time and do really well," said the 24-year-old Jane.The Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies player added that she was looking forward to playing an important role."It is such an honour for me to be selected vice-captain again, but I know we've got other senior players like Noko Matlou and Mpumi Nyandeni," she said."They are also there to help out, especially with the young players."South Africa are in Group A with hosts Cameroon, Egypt and Zimbabwe, while Group B consists of Nigeria, Mali, Ghana and Kenya.Banyana will fly out to Cameroon today ahead of their opening match against Zimbabwe at Stade de Yaounde on Saturday.
