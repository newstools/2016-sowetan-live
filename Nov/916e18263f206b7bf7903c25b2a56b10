The Chamber of Mines on Thursday said the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) had chosen to produce its own version of a draft reviewed Mining Charter without properly engaging any stakeholder other than their receiving submissions .It said this was unlike previous charters where stakeholders in the Mining Industry Growth Development and Employment Task Team worked together to produce a stakeholder-agreed proposal . The chamber has met the DMR on two occasions following the publication of the DMR draft for bilateral discussions. In both meetings the chamber raised specific areas of concern it said in a statement. As far as we can tell the DMR has taken none of these issues on board and clearly the meetings were limited consultations with the DMR having little appetite to hear the industry s concerns. It said that as mining companies are the actual implementers of the charter it will be difficult to accede to an outcome based on a flawed process . TMG Digital
