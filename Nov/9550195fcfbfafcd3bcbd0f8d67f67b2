Vodacom came under fire yesterday when the lawyer of the businessman who accused the mobile giant of stealing his money-spinning idea told the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg that the company should have paid its inventor.Advocate Dean Ehrlich told Judge Colin Lamont that Vodacom should have compensated his client, entrepreneur John Khaba of Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, before re-purposing his airtime advance ideaKhaba had presented the idea to the company's then chief operations officer Vuyani Jarana in April 2010.Vodacom launched airtime advance in May 2011.Ehrlich said Khaba was not acknowledged as the developer and inventor of Vodacom's airtime advance product."The defendant [Vodacom] has chosen to use, persist in using the plaintiff's [Khaba's] solution," he said.According to Ehrlich, Vodacom has no choice but to negotiate with Khaba.He said the company makes considerable profits from the idea.Khaba is demanding five cents of every rand Vodacom has made from the product as compensation.Earlier this year, Sowetan reported that Vodacom's airtime advance had over one million subscribers within a month of its launch.In 2014, Vodacom generated R25.8-billion from its mobile voice products while the company also sold voice bundles worth R576-million.Its prepaid active customers increased to 27.2million in the same period.Yesterday, Lamont heard arguments in Vodacom's exception, which is a legal objection to Khaba's pleadings.In its heads of argument, Vodacom said Khaba failed to set out the necessary facts that need to be proven for his action to succeed.Richard Solomon, for Vodacom, told Lamont that the two sections [10 and 25] of the constitution cited by Khaba were not applicable in the case because an idea is not property."It's not property, we haven't deprived him of any property," Solomon said.Lamont asked: "But you accept in theory that there is deprivation?"Solomon responded: "I don't, my lord."He said Vodacom had not stopped Khaba from using his idea."He can take it to another network," Solomon said."You should have contracted with them if you wanted to use their idea," Lamont said.Solomon responded: "This solution is not property and they can still take it elsewhere."He said Vodacom had no obligation to enter into an agreement with Khaba's company Ndabenhle Business Enterprises, of which he is the sole director.Khaba's solution involved buying additional prepaid airtime in bulk for operators of Vodacom's cellphone containers in townships on credit and they would later repay Khaba who would get five cents for every rand advanced to operators by Vodacom.To his surprise, Vodacom launched a similar product a year later.Lamont reserved judgment yesterday.sidimbal@sowetan.co.za
