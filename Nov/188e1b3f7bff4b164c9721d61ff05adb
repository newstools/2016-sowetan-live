South Africa may have suffered disappointment in World Cup qualification campaigns in the past but one thing that is clear is that they have always been very tough to beat at home in the preliminaries for the global showpiece.They take on in-form Senegal in Polokwane on Saturday in their second qualifier for the 2018 tournament in Russia where a defeat would likely end any realistic hopes of making it to the World Cup.Bafana have played in 22 home qualifiers before and only lost two of those both to powerful west African sides who would go on to feature at the finals.South Africa lost 2-0 to Ghana in 2005 with the Black Stars going on to be Africa s top representatives in the finals in Germany the following year.Asamoah Gyan Samuel Kuffour Michael Essien Stephen Appiah Sulley Muntari and John Paintsil made up a star-studded selection for the Ghanaians who had won their home qualifier 3-0 against Stuart Baxter s side.Bafana s only other defeat came in a qualifier against Nigeria in Port Elizabeth during the horror that was the Joel Santana tenure in 2008 as they went down 1-0 to an Ike Uche goal.Although South Africa qualified for the finals as hosts the qualifiers doubled up as the preliminaries for the 2010 African Nations Cup as Bafana failed to reach the Angola.But aside from those two blemishes the other 20 World Cup qualifying games they have played since reintroduction to international football in 1992 have yielded 16 wins and four draws a healthy return given the calibre of some of their opponents.They first entered the qualifiers for the finals ahead of the USA tournament in 1994 with their first ever game a 4-0 away loss to Nigeria in Lagos that was a huge wake-up call for the fledgling national side.Their first home qualifier went much better as Phil Masinga netted the only goal in a 1-0 win over Congo-Brazzaville. Despite a home draw with Nigeria and an away win in the Congo they failed to qualify.And it has largely been a tale of success at home base since then bar perhaps two disappointing draws the second of which would prove costly and spell the end for Pitso Mosimane s tenure at the helm of the side.A 0-0 against Sierra Leone (2008) was notable in that appears in the book of convicted match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal as one in which he alleged he paid certain Leone Stars defenders to concede goals and still Bafana could not score.A draw at home to Ethiopia (2012) proved the final straw for SAFA as they axed Mosimane and replaced him with Steve Komphela who drew the next qualifier in Botswana 1-1 and then beat Gabon 3-0 in a friendly. The fulltime coaching job went to Gordon Igesund.The current Bafana side under Shakes Mashaba are on a 13-match unbeaten run against all opposition home and away with their last home loss to Angola in the African Nations Championship qualifiers last year. - TMG Digital
