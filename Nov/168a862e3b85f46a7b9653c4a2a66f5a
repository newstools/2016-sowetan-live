Acting Bafana Bafana coach Owen da Gama will ring the changes for tonight's friendly against Mozambique in Maputo (7pm).Bafana meet the Black Mambas at the 40000-seater Estadio Nacional do Zimpeto and Da Gama said he will use the friendly to give more players a run in an attempt to create a bigger pool for selection."We need competition in all positions in the team, hence we will use the friendly to look at other options. This is good for the team," said Da Gama, according to a statement sent out by Safa.Da Gama will basically be doing what suspended coach Shakes Mashaba was planning to do before he was left behind in SA owing to his suspension.Bafana are ranked 62nd in the world football, while Mozambique are placed 95th. And while Bafana beat Senegal 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier at Peter Mokaba Stadium at the weekend, Mozambique lost 1-0 to Kenya in a friendly in Nairobi.Defender Rivaldo Coetzee will miss the match after he picked up an ankle injury, but all other players are available for selection.Meanwhile, Mambas coach Abel Xavier said: "Our aim is to build a stronger side by utilising all the Fifa dates."We want to play sides that will offer us a challenge and I am relishing Tuesday's challenge."
