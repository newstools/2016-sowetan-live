You get the feeling Gordon Igesund cannot wait until the January transfer window opens, so that he can bolster his defence.Highlands Park have conceded 21 goals in 10 matches, making theirs the worst defence in the league. Their 5-0 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus on Sunday was just a clear sign that they need reinforcements at the back or they could be back in the National First Division next season.Against Bloemfontein Celtic, at Makhulong Stadium tonight [7.30pm], Highlands need senior players such as Rudi Isaacs and Eddie Ngalo to take charge in order to minimise mistakes in crucial areas of the pitch, which was their downfall against Sundowns."It was a good lesson for my team against Sundowns. They know we have to work hard. We are not 100% to where we want to be and we need to strengthen our team. We have to decide by the time the [transfer] window opens who we are going to get," said coach Igesund."The big thing is that we have conceded 19 or 20 goals [actually 21], which is a hell of a lot."I have to look at strengthening the defence and certain areas in the midfield. The two players I got, [Lindokuhle] Mbatha and [Surprise] Moriri, were were out of contract. Right now I will give players an opportunity to prove themselves. Some of them are young boys, so I am not upset with them at all."Celtic, who are doing a fairly well under interim coaches John Maduka and Lehlohonolo Seema, will arrive at Makhulong Stadium believing they can get a result away from home.
