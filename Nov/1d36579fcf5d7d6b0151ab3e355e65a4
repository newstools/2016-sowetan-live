Corruption Watch on Friday welcomed the decision by Brian Molefe to resign as Eskom chief executive officer saying this is in the best interests of Eskom. Its prominence as a major state owned enterprise requires that the public has confidence in its operations functioning and leadership. The allegations against Molefe... must however continue to be the subject of inquiry by the pending judicial commission of inquiry into state capture and should also be investigated by the relevant law enforcement authorities. Corruption Watch said any alleged irregular conduct on the part of Molefe was not possible without the consent of the board of Eskom. The organisation urges the members of the board to consider whether their continued leadership of the parastatal is in fact in the best interests of Eskom.
