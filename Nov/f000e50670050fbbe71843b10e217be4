The CAF Super Cup clash against TP Mazembe may still be three months away for Mamelodi Sundowns, but coach Pitso Mosimane has already started watching matches of the opposition team.Sundowns, the CAF Champions League winners thanks to a victory over Zamalek last month, will host Confederations Cup champions Mazembe, who beat Algerian side MO Bejaia in the final last week.Mazembe beat Sundowns 3-2 on aggregate in the qualifying rounds of last year's Champions League, as they went on to win the biggest prize on the continent.Sundowns gave Mazembe a tough match and it won't be different when they meet in the Super Cup in February. The team that wins the Champions League hosts the game."Their games are stored. I have watched them already. The same Mazembe we played is the same Mazembe we will play. They have the same strategy and the same players. It's only two who were not there when we played them," said Mosimane, who even knows what the starting line-up could look like."They are still terrific in attack. They have Rainford Kalaba. They still have Roger Assal , Solomon Asante, Nathan Sankala, (Adama) Traore, (Salif) Coulibaly. They still have left-back (Kilitcho) Kasusula. They have an Ivorian goalkeeper now. They still have (Daniel) Adjei, the Ghanaian. I know them well."Before the Super Cup match, Sundowns will play in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan next month.On Saturday, they will face Kaizer Chiefs in the Absa Premiership at Loftus (3.30pm).
