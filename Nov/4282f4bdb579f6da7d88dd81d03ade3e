Ahead of tonight's Women's Africa Cup of Nations semifinals, we look at the statistics that could count in favour or against the four hopefuls in their chase for berths in the final.Banyana conceded one goal in the group phase, which was late in their clash against Cameroon. Interim coach Desiree Ellis has expressed satisfaction with the rearguard led by captain Janine van Wyk, who has shown her experience having made her 140th appearance against Egypt. Nigeria also conceded one goal in their match against Ghana.Banyana's strike force remains a concern despite netting five times against Egypt . Nigeria scored 11 in their three outings against Mali (6-0 win), Ghana (1-1) and Kenya (4-0 win). Banyana will do well to keep an eye on Arsenal's Asasat Oshoala, who has six goals .Cameroon v Ghana (Omnisports Ahmadou Ahidjo, Yaound , 5pm)The hosts are the only team that has not conceded so far. Ghana's defence has been breached by all their three opponents, including one against probably one of the weakest teams in the tournament, Kenya, who finished bottom of the group.The "Indomitable Lionesses" haven't really got the bite up front with five goals in three matches. They also needed a controversial goal to separate themselves from Banyana after goalkeeper Andile Dlamini was knocked off the ball when she had it in her hands.So the likes of Henriette Akaba (two goals in the tournament) and the reigning African Footballer of the Year Gaelle Onguene have to step up. The "Black Queens" may not have defended well so far, but they have been better upfront having scored seven goals.
