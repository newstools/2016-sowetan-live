Parliament s watchdog overseeing the spending of taxpayers money sent the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) packing on Wednesday for failing to produce information it had requested about the irregular expenditure of more than R1 billion.Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) chair Themba Godi said that the committee was shocked at the apparent lack of preparation displayed by the roads agency after it had been invited to give a detailed presentation. Sanral s presentation was vague with no specific information and the chairperson of the board and the management of Sanral could not give answers to the questions asked by members of the committee said a statement issued on behalf of Godi.The roads agency was instructed to gather all the necessary information including details of who is responsible for the irregular expenditure amounting to R1.1 billion and whether that amount has been recovered. The committee is expecting a full response by November 23. TMG Digital
