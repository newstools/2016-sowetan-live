The elderly mother of Victor Mlotshwa the Middleburg man who was allegedly assaulted and forced into a coffin had to be whisked away to hospital on Wednesday morning.This happened just a few minutes after the two accused Willem Oostheizen and Theo Martins Jackson abandoned their bail application at the Middleburg Magistrates Court.The highly emotional mother refused to speak with the media and was visibly distraught.Outside the court building the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) held mini-rallies where they addressed their supporters. A heavy police presence kept both crowds at bay and there was no violence.The ANC crowd was addressed by Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela and regional chairperson Speed Mashilo.Moela used the opportunity to lambast the EFF and Democratic Alliance for their presence at the court case. Victor is an ANC and ANC Youth League member. All these clowns that are here are opportunistic Moela said.At the other end of the road leading up to the court EFF supporters were addressed by the party s national spokesman Mbuyiseli Ndlozi.Ndlozi claimed that police had not acted until his party highlighted the issue: We can not allow a situation where we live with racists. It is only when the EFF put a spotlight on them then police acted. The case has been postponed until January 25 next year for further investigation. The accused declined to apply for bail saying they feared for their lives. TMG Digital/The Times
