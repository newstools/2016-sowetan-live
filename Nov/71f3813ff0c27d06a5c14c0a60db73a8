Outspoken FeesMustFall leader Mcebo Dlamini says President Jacob Zuma should step down before finishing his term of office saying his time is over .In an exclusive interview with TMG Digital Dlamini 30 said: He has played his part and I think fresh legs must take over. If you compare politics to a game of soccer which is 90 minutes it doesn t mean you have to finish the 90 minutes. You can start as part of the first 11 but when you are tired you must be substituted so that we win the match. His remarks come as more African National Congress bigwigs and former party luminaries have joined the growing chorus of people calling for Zuma to resign.These calls grew stronger after the Constitutional Court s unanimous judgment that found the president had failed to uphold his oath of office and breached the Constitution when he failed to implement the findings of the public protector s report on his Nkandla home upgrades.The chorus grew louder after the release of the public protector s State of Capture report in which Thuli Madonsela raised concerns about Zuma including the president s links to the Gupta family the juggling of finance ministers Nhlanhla Nene and Des van Rooyen and that he may have breached the Code of Ethics. I think he [Zuma] has played his part and we have seen what he can contribute but we now need fresh minds and fresh legs to take the country forward. We can t wait and afford for him to finish the 90 minutes (his term of office) because if he is a left back the opposition is entering through the back because the left back is tired said Dlamini.Hardly was the question of who should replace Zuma asked Dlamini interjected: Cyril Ramaphosa must take over. He must lead us to 2019. The student leader of the Fees Must Fall movement at the University of the Witwatersrand was granted bail of R2000 by the Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court on Wednesday after spending 27 days in custody awaiting trial.He is facing charges of public violence theft malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. His next court appearance is on November 15 at the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court. TMG Digital
