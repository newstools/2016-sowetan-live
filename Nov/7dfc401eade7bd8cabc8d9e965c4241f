Injury hampered striker Andrea Fileccia will be hoping for an all-clear from a specialist in Johannesburg on Tuesday as he seeks a return from a second setback this year.He has missed Maritzburg United s last seven games since developing a hip injury that has come just weeks after he made his comeback in the Premier Soccer League.The Belgian striker was the top marksman in the league last season before suffering a serious knee injury in January that ruled him out for the rest of the 2015-16 campaign.Free State Stars agreed to terminate his contract in June and Maritzburg picked him up without paying a transfer fee.The 24-year-old Fileccia made a much quicker than expected recovery and debuted for his new club in their opening game of the season which was a 1-0 away win at Bloemfontein Celtic.But he was taken off at half-time. He made one substitute appearance since September s goalless draw with champions Mamelodi Sundowns and has had just 58 minutes of game time in the new campaign.Fileccia has been back at training this week and is hoping that if the doctor says he is free to play again he will feature in Saturday s away clash at Ajax Cape Town. - TMG Digital
