The Presidency says it is unfortunate that a tweet by Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba seeks to create an impression that a police convoy transporting President Jacob Zuma caused the death of a man in Pretoria on Friday.The presidency said this was totally untrue and misleading. The Presidency was alerted to a tweet reportedly by Mashaba alleging that President Jacob Zuma s convoy was involved in a fatal car accident on Friday. The tweet states as follows: I have just received the terrible news that President Zuma s blue lights brigades killed a friend Solly Moutlana yesterday. The President was in East London on Friday to participate in the National Council of Province s Taking Parliament to the People event having travelled from Cape Town. From East London he flew to KwaZulu-Natal province. He left Pretoria on Tuesday presidency spokesman Dr Bongani Ngqulunga said in a statement on Sunday.He said the presidency on enquiry had been informed that police were investigating a case involving a pedestrian being knocked over by a car driven by a police officer in Pretoria. The pedestrian subsequently died. The Presidency extends heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased on this tragic loss. The Presidency remains ready to assist the Mayor of Johannesburg in future with clarity on matters affecting the Presidency to ensure the accuracy of information being disseminated. Mashaba s spokesman Tony Taverna-Turisan confirmed that the tweet came from Mashaba s account but said he could not immediately comment.He said Mashaba would visit the family on Sunday afternoon to get more details before he could comment.TMG Digital
