There is so much expected from Daine Klate after his recall to Bafana Bafana but the midfielder has insisted yesterday that the team is more important than him.The 31-year-old is part of the squad to face Senegal in a 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday at 3pm.Klate has created high expectations from the nation as the winger has been in great form for Bidvest Wits this season.Already, Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba has highlighted the importance of the winger's call-up, which the coach said was prompted by a lack of deliveries from the left wing."I'm here for a reason obviously, which is to be part of the team and to do duty for the country. It is not about me," said the Port Elizabeth-born player."Nothing is more important to me than the cause of the team and I think, in all fairness and respect to my teammates and the country, I can't be talking about myself when I'm representing the country. So my job here is to help the team get the three points on Saturday in whatever capacity."
