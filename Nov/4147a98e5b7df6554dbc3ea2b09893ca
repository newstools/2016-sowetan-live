Tendai Ndoro's first-half goal saw Orlando Pirates consign Chippa United to their second consecutive defeat last night.Ahead of the game, coach Dan Malesela said his side needed to tighten up their defence and also work on getting the ball inside the net.These are two elements that need serious intervention going forward if Chippa want to get back to their winning form. The loss comes after a 2-1 loss to Cape Town City on Saturday.It's been over a month now since the Port Elizabeth-based side last recorded a league victory.For Pirates it was job well done for caretaker coach Augusto Palacios as he clinched his third victory in as many matches since he replaced Muhsin Ertugral. At first, the Buccaneers found it difficult to break a resilient Chippa defence.However, they let it slip when they let Ndoro to sneak in his ninth league goal in as many fixtures 20 minutes into the game. Three minutes later, Thembinkosi Lorch tried to pull one back for the hosts but his attempt went straight into goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane.Mabokgwane, who debuted in Bucs' 1-0 win over Free State Stars at the weekend, produced some solid saves. He denied Andile Mbenyane and David Zulu among the closest attempt by Chippa in the opening half. Both teams came out fired up in the second half, with Bucs looking to extend their lead and Chippa desperate to find an equaliser. Luvuyo Memela's effort came short when the ball hit the side of the net in the 53rd minute.Chippa did not lie down as they also came out guns blazing, with striker Katlego Mashego a constant threat each time the former Bucs man surged forward.He too was denied by Mabokgwane. Chippa created many chances following that but they just could not find the back of the net.However, drama unfolded towards the end of the game when Chippa protested that Patrick Phungwayo had brought down Mashego inside the box when the striker was about to launch a shot. l Elsewhere, Ajax Cape Town recorded their first win of the season with a 3-2 victory over Platinum Stars at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in North West.Ajax scored through Bantu Mzwakali, Prince Nxumalo and an own goal by Steven Hoffman.Stars pulled two back in the second half through Vuyo Mere and Benson Shilongo, but the Urban Warriors held on for their first three points of the campaign.l Cape Town City also hung on for a 3-2 victory over Maritzburg United at Athlone Stadium last night.Lehlohonolo Majoro, Sibusiso Masina and Lebogang Manyama scored for City, while Brian Onyango and Evans Rusike netted in a see-saw encounter.
