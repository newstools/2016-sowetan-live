Sam Meyiwa the father of the late footballer Senzo Meyiwa has again hit out at songstress Kelly Khumalo accusing her of trying to make a quick buck by writing a song about his son.Sam is clearly not a fan of Kelly s decision to include a song about Senzo on her new album My Truth.Speaking to Daily Sun recently he said that Kelly had written the song simply to irritate him and his wife.He apparently told the paper that Kelly was happy that Senzo was dead and that she wanted to cash in on his name with the song. Where did this girl come from? What does she want from us? How much more pain does she want me and my family to suffer? Uyeyisa lentomba-zane (this girl is being disrespectful). The truth we want from her is who killed my son not to make songs we do not understand Sam told the paper.This is not the first time that Sam has ranted about the song which Kelly wrote in tribute to her late boyfriend.Just last month Sam told Sunday World that he hoped Kelly would get arrested on stage while performing the track. I m sure she was involved (in Senzo s death). I wish she could get arrested while on stage performing the song. She can go ahead making money with the song but it ll curse her for the rest of her life Sam said.But Kelly is not fazed by Sam s criticism and has instead focused on channelling her emotions into her music.Speaking about the song to City Press recently Kelly said that writing the song had brought back the pain she felt when Senzo died. You have to be in the moment if you are going to write a sincere song. It took me back and it was quite an emotional song. But it needed to be done. Senzo will remain a special person in my life. I am not trying to replace him Kelly said.
