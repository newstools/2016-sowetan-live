Parents of pupils at Makgoathane Primary School at Makotse village in Zebediela, Limpopo, are grateful their children will no longer study under trees.Lessons at the school have for the past two months been conducted under trees after the parents raised concerns that the dilapidated classrooms posed danger to the pupils and teachers.The school building, which had huge cracks and a collapsing roof, was built by the community in 1960.It had not been renovated since.When Sowetan visited the school last month, the rickety structure was cordoned off with a no-entry tape to shield the pupils and teachers from the obvious danger.The provincial department of education a week ago finally delivered the mobile classrooms for the pupils .The school has 749 pupils in Grades R to 7 and with 22 teachers, including the principal.The chairman of the school governing body Peter Mashiloane said the department had even surpassed their expectations."We had expected at least four mobile classrooms but five had been delivered."We are happy that our children will from now learn under a conducive environment." .Mashiloane said the governing body had also resolved to slaughter a cow on December 1 to celebrate the mobile classrooms."We had struggled a lot trying to get the department to come to the party to assist with resources."We also want to thank Sowetan for exposing conditions at the school and highlighting our plight to the public," he added.Another parent, Sarah Modiba, said: "Remember we had embarked on a peaceful strike by removing our children from the school until a new building was constructed."We then allowed them to return to school on condition they attended lessons under trees for safety reasons."Now we have a reason to celebrate what the department has done for the school," Modiba said.She, however added, that parents still wanted to know when a new building would be constructed at the school."The last time we checked on the priority list for the Capricorn district, we were sitting at number seven."We just hope that the list does not get tempered with."Provincial education spokesman, Naledzani Rasila, said he was unsure in which financial year the building would be constructed."We do have an infrastructure plan which guides us which projects would come first," Rasila said."But if indeed they are seventh on the priority list surely they will have a school in the 2017/18 financial years."Despite its poor state, the school still has a few classrooms that were still in good condition and therefore usable.frankm@sowetan.co.za
