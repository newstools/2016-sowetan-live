Had Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela not believed in the ability of Lorenzo Gordinho, then Amakhosi would have signed an experienced central defender after a difficult season in defence last term.It makes Gordinho feel good that he was given time to grow in his first full season as a regular in the heart of Amakhosi's defence.Now he's playing a big part in the team's rearguard, which has kept seven clean sheets in all competitions this season, and he's the club's top scorer with three goals.What's special about Gordinho's progress is that he came from the Chiefs development structures.He is a rare graduate as this does not happen as often as it used to."I was given a chance to grow and make my mistakes. It was difficult [last season] because there was a lot of expectation on the club. I was young and I did not understand fully what people expected," said the 22-year-old. "Now I have more of an understanding and I feel I have grown. But now I have to live up to the expectations. I don't think there's a player who would not want to play for Chiefs. You want to be inside the pressure. The pressure will mould you."Gordinho has become popular with the Amakhosi fans."I think they have [warmed up]. A few of the ones I am close to, like the petrol attendants and shopkeepers in Benoni, gave me slack for missing the penalty against Free State Stars [Telkom Knockout]. But it's OK because afterwards they joke about it."The SA U-23 defender is pleased with how his decision-making has improved. There's more to work on, like scoring more and using his left foot. Gordinho is expected to play a key role when Chiefs visit Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus on Saturday (3.30pm), a game that is arguably the pick of the Absa Premiership fixtures.
