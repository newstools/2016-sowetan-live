Close to one in three of the active leases entered into by the Department of Public Works (DPW) is under investigation by the Special Investigative Unit (SIU).The Democratic Alliance (DA) said this was revealed in a reply to parliamentary question by Justice Minister Michael Masutha that showed out of 2176 active leases 649 are under investigation .He said the investigation pertains to the leases being not fair competitive transparent equitable or cost-effective. The department s claim that there not enough money for it to carry out its mandate can no longer be accepted until the large number of irregular leases are either corrected or relinquished by the DPW the DA said in reaction. The DA will be submitting parliamentary questions to ascertain how much these 649 leases currently under investigation are costing the department. The party also said it will ask Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi for an explanation as to why Mthatha in the Eastern Cape with 27 irregular leases was listed separately to the province which has the highest number of irregular leases under investigation out of all the provinces at 142 irregular leases? Mthatha falls within the Eastern Cape and we will request the reasoning behind the separate listing as it may be an attempt to deflate the high number of leases in the Eastern Cape the DA said. We will fight to ensure that the Minister of Public Works and his department are held accountable if the findings of the SIU show negligence and disregard for proper procedure and judicious government. Masutha s reply indicated that the investigations into the leases are only expected to be completed in March 2018.To be completed in March 2017 according to Masutha is an investigation into the refurbishment of ministerial homes in and around Cape Town at allegedly vastly inflated costs .
