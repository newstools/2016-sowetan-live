Shakes Mashaba faces an anxious seven days as a Safa disciplinary committee waits to decide his future a week today.The hearing was initially set for Tuesday but was postponed to next Thursday on the grounds that Mashaba, the suspended Bafana Bafana coach, hadn't had a chance to go through the charge sheet.It has emerged that the combustible coach and his legal team were furnished with the charges only this week, giving them insufficient time to formulate a defence against claims that he brought Safa into disrepute with his behaviour post Bafana's victory over Senegal in a World Cup qualifier nearly two weeks ago."I can confirm that the hearing will take place on December 1, but I can't comment on labour issues," said Safa spokesman Dominic Chimhavi.Sowetan has established that Mashaba's charge sheet includes his frequent confrontations with the media, insubordination and misconduct."We've allowed him some leeway when it comes to media relations. We asked him to seek to improve his relationship with journalists because with these outbursts, he was harming the image of Safa. But that behaviour in Polokwane [on November 12] was the final straw," a Safa insider said.A video clip where Mashaba is seen exchanging words with an SABC TV presenter in the aftermath of Bafana's 2-1 win over Senegal, while refusing to shake hands with the Safa leadership, will be presented as evidence of his alleged misconduct. He is also said to have had an argument with the Safa hierarchy inside the tunnel at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.Indications are that the coach, unless he mounts a strong defence, will be out of job by next Friday, throwing Bafana's World Cup dream into disarray with four more qualifiers to follow next year."We want this matter to be finalised as soon as next week. It's not fair to have it hanging for long," added the Safa informer. If he's sacked, it would be the third time that Mashaba is removed from the Bafana post for disagreement with his employer.
