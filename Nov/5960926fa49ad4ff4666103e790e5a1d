Free State Stars' Italian coach Giovanni Solinas watched his team go down 1-0 away at Orlando Pirates, their fourth defeat in nine matches along with five draws, and bemoaned his team's lack of a clinical edge in the final third of the pitch.Solinas was relatively happy with the performance of his team despite the defeat and accepted that his charges need more creativity and invention going forward."I'm happy with the performance of my team. It's a pity the result didn't go our way and yes, we are disappointed," Solinas said after the match.Despite a late comeback from Stars, who threatened Jackson Mabokgwane's goal deep in the second half, the visitors just could not score."You know sometimes in football you create one chance and you score and you win the game with one opportunity. Sometimes you create more chances and you don't score," Solinas said. "Yes, we need some improvements in our final third. We need more determination in the last 20 metres because in the first half we had a great opportunity to score."Pirates also created a lot of goalscoring chances and could have won by a bigger margin had it not been for the brilliance of the former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns keeper. - TMG Digital
