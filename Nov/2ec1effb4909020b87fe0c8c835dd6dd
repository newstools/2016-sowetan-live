Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has reprimanded his Mamelodi Sundowns counterpart Pitso Mosimane over the "five defenders" statement.The Sundowns coach said Chiefs played five at the back in Amakhosi's Telkom Knockout defeat to Free State Stars a couple of weeks ago and Komphela has not taken kindly to that. Komphela says Mosimane's comments were sending out the wrong message.This after Chiefs lost 2-1 to Sundowns in their epic Absa Premiership clash at Loftus at the weekend."Let me debunk the myth of five. I will never be aggressive, I will try to be rational. It's a seed that was planted by a man who was not supposed to and an expert in our field," retorted Komphela."It's 3-4-3 [formation]. You have three centre backs and two wing backs. A wing back is a winger and a fullback, in football terms. Who scored today?"Rama [Mphahlele]. When we attack, he is high up there. To my colleague, I would reprimand him to say don't sell a wrong message of thinking it's five defenders. Maybe a message to our colleagues; refrain from misinformation. We have a responsibility to lead, not mislead. It's highly offensive."
