Having played for Kaizer Chiefs in the past, Thuso Phala knows the immense pressure Amakhosi players are under right now.Chiefs' winless streak was extended to four matches by Mamelodi Sundowns at the weekend, and Phala believes Amakhosi will be under even more pressure to deliver when they host SuperSport at FNB tonight (7.30pm).This, Phala suggests, could be to SuperSport's advantage, especially if Matsatsantsa score an early goal, a move that could unsettle Chiefs players and coach Steve Komphela in front of their ever demanding fans."They are from a defeat and they will be wounded, so it will be a tough game. They are under pressure to win at home and that could be to our advantage," said Phala, who is one of nine former Amakhosi players in the SuperSport squad."Playing for Chiefs in itself is a lot of pressure. When the team is not doing well, they are under pressure. We should try and get an early goal and they will be rattled."Phala, of course, is smart enough to know Amakhosi cannot be written off despite their recent barren run. "They are up there on the [Absa Premiership] log. They are title contenders, you cannot write them off. They have quality players. They are a big team," said the 30-year-old winger.The Amakhosi defence has conceded four goals in the last two matches, which should be a big concern because they face the league's top scorers in SuperSport, who have banged in 15 goals in their nine matches.
