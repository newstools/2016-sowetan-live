Athletics SA (ASA) has assembled five of the country's best ultra distance runners to tackle the IAU 100km World Championships in Spain later this month.The team comprises four of the five men who have won the Comrades Marathon since 2012.They are reigning champion David Gatebe, Gift Kelehe, Bong'musa Mthembu, Ludwick Mamabolo as well as this year's third place finisher Rufus Photo.The quintet will be chasing the world record in the 100km race in Los Alcazareson on November 27.Guided by Gatebe's coach John Hamlett, the team is in their second week of preparations in Dullstroom, Mpumalanga, for high altitude training."We believe the team has the ability to break the team world record and bring the crown home," said ASA president Aleck Skhosana yesterday.Skhosana said Dullstroom is the perfect place for high altitude training and has been used by many athletes to prepare for international competitions.Among those who prepare at the secluded Mpumalanga town are Gatebe and Caroline Wostmann, the 2015 Comrades and Two Oceans Marathon winner."It is a pity that at this stage we are able to send a male team only but we hope ASA will in future have the necessary funding to enable us to have a female team as well," said Skhosana.Hamlett will be assisted by Enoch Skosana while veteran local athletics administrator George Lamb has been appointed the team manager.The team will depart for Spain on November 24.The global 100km championships is sanctioned by the International Association of Ultrarunners.Japanese Takahiro Sunada holds the record of 6:13:33 which he set in his home country in June 1998.- Meanwhile, the Soweto Marathon Trust has extended its condolences to the family and friends of Hendrik Matthys, who died while participating in the 21km at the Old Mutual Soweto Marathon on Sunday.The 65-year-old Matthys from the Northern Cape collapsed and died two kilometres from the finish line."We are extremely saddened by this news."On behalf of the Trust I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his daughter Chantell and all other members of his family and friends."We are truly sorry for your huge loss," said Soweto Marathon Trust chairperson Sello Khunou yesterday.
