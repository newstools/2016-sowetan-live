As a player, Reneilwe Letsholonyane has proven to be one of the best of his generation. But would he be as great as a coach? Well we can never really know until he becomes one.The SuperSport United midfielder says he would consider going into coaching once he retires, but he is still going strong on the pitch at age 34, so that might not be any time soon."I think I would [go into coaching]. I want to learn and I am open to everything, as long as it will help me grow as a person," Letsholonyane said.It's been 10 years since he started playing regularly in the PSL, when he joined Jomo Cosmos at the age of 24, from PJ Stars. Since then, he has worked with a number of coaches and he has picked up different aspects of the game that he would take into his coaching career one day.
