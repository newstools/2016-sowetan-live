Bidvest Wits are still waiting for the swelling of Xola Mlambo s ankle to subside before they will know whether their new star has a serious injury or can be back in action before the Christmas break.It has been almost a month now since the hard-tackling defensive midfielder suffered the injury in action against his old club Chippa United who sold him to Wits in July.The 25-year-old Mlambo who has been one of the top signings of the last months quickly bedded down a first team berth at Wits and was part of their MTN8-winning team.Doctors were scheduled to make a decision on possible surgery this week but that has been postponed by a week said the club s chief executive officer Jose Ferreira on Monday.In the meantime the ankle is being protected by a moon boot. Conservative treatment is always best at first and we will see what needs to be done if anything Ferreira added. But we are waiting another week. Wits have two games this week as they meet SuperSport United away at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit on Tuesday night and then host Cape Town City at home on Friday. - TMG Sport
