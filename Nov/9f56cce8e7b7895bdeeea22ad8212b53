It's fascinating how everything has worked out for Eric Tinkler in the last few months.Replaced by Muhsin Ertugral at Orlando Pirates after the club decided against renewing his contract, Tinkler headed to Cape Town City who were coached by the Turk last season as Mpumalanga Black Aces.Tinkler is now flourishing at City, who are in second place in the league and have a Telkom Knockout final date booked with SuperSport United on December 10.It's certainly not bad at all for a team that had to make a lot of changes in the playing personnel.After losing in two finals with Pirates - the CAF Confederation and Nedbank Cup - Tinkler will be hoping to get his first gold medal as a coach and build on from that.By reaching the final, City have broken the monopoly of the traditional cup finalists in this competition.Since 2006, the Telkom Knockout final has featured either Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs or Mamelodi Sundowns eight times, but City and SuperSport have broken the norm.City will feel they have a good chance of winning the competition, with a talented squad featuring the likes of Lehlohonolo Majoro, Lebogang Manyama, Thato Mokeke, Aubrey Ngoma and Bongelwethu Jayiya. These players have caused a lot of problems for the opposition and it won't be any different in the final.Can City pull off yet another giant-slaying act when they face Chiefs at FNB Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm)?Well, it will be the second meeting between the two sides this campaign after City surprised the Soweto giants in the MTN8 quarterfinals earlier this season.
