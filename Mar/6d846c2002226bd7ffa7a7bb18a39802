A young woman lost her life early on Wednesday when she was electrocuted after tripping over exposed electricity wires. Her lifeless body was found with severe burn wound to her hand and back by paramedics from ER24. The company said the woman‚ a resident in the Jika Joe rural settlement on East Street in Pietermaritzburg‚ was believed to be in her late 20s. “Unfortunately nothing could be done for the patient and she was declared dead on scene‚” ER24 said. “It is believed the woman had been walking along when she tripped and fell into the exposed wires‚ which had been apparently illegally connected. “Local authorities were on scene to disconnect the connections and for further investigations.”
