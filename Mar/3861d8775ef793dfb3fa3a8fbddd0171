Cardinal George Pell, under fire for his handling of sexual abuse of children by priests in Australia, on Thursday acknowledged “the evil that was done” and vowed to work with survivors to better protect children in future. Pell, who gave four days of evidence via video link to an Australian government commission on sexual abuse, made the comments after a nearly two-hour-long meeting with about a dozen Australian survivors who had flown to Rome for the hearings.
