Springbok rugby player Siya Kolisi appears to have unknowingly borrowed a page out of singer Lira s book by resolving to ignore internet trolls who have taken issue with his marriage to Rachel who is white.Speaking to The Times Lira said she too had been a victim of vitriolic insults from people who took issue with her marriage to music producer Robin Kohl. We have weathered that storm. In the beginning of course it was there and we don t find that kind of commentary any more because people get over it. 'I don't have time for racists' - Springbok Siya Kolisi These people don t build your life in any way so you really can t care they really don t matter. People on the internet try their luck they use the platform just because they can. said Lira. Her comments follow a weekend Facebook rant by Hannes Lottering who shared a picture of Kolisi and his wife saying: I pray that this does not happen in my family. Honest to God I would not know what to do. On Monday Kolisi said he would not respond to online trolls. I ignore things like that They don t make any difference in my life. All that this is going to do is just waste my time Kolisi told TMG Digital. Rachel Kolisi tweeted: I won t turn a blind eye. It will not be ignored. She did not provide context to the tweet. The couple tied the knot in Cape Town in August and have been victims of racist attacks ever since. In October Rachel Kolisi said she would limit her social media activity due to online bullying and attacks. Meanwhile Webber Wenzel media and information lawyer Dario Milo said the couple has recourse through the Equality Court and the Human Rights Commission. He said the firm is involved in a number of cases involving abuse on social media involving reputational damage. The hate speech law will create a criminal offence of hate speech but racists will sadly always be racists. Unfortunately there is a limit to what laws can do to change disgraceful behaviour said Milo. TMG Digital/The Times
