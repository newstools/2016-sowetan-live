You'd probably think Cape Town City captain Lebogang Manyama is playing so well because he feels he has to deliver as the leader of the team, but it has nothing to do with the armband.This is the first time Manyama has ever captained any side at least at professional level, but the forward has explained that it is about repaying the club's faith in him and enjoying his game.Manyama was one of the first few players to be offered a new contract by the club after John Comitis bought the club from Mpumalanga Black Aces.Towards the end of last season, reports emerged that Aces had exercised their one year option on Manyama's contract.But instead of holding him to that Comitis offered new terms and Manyama put pen to paper on a new two-year contract.This was despite the fact that Manyama had spent six months on the sidelines after breaking three toes in February in a clash with Ajax Cape Town."No, it is not about being the captain. Obviously the team got sold, but luckily for me the team wasn't bought by a stranger. I have worked with John before (at Ajax Cape Town) and I know how he is," said the Alexandra-born midfielder."He welcomed me with an injury. I was out for months, but I was made the captain of the team and that boosted my morale," he said.The 26-year-old has arguably been one of the best players in the league this season with eight goals to his name in all competitions, including a brace in their 3-2 win against Bidvest Wits last week."I'm very grateful for the support and I'm just repaying them, but obviously it is never about me. It is about the team and for me, as long as the team is doing well I'm very happy," he added.Manyama is now looking forward to the Telkom Knockout final against his former club SuperSport United at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (6pm).
