The country has again escaped a potentially catastrophic credit downgrade to junk but it remains on the precipice as the agency drops the local currency rating one notch.SA can breathe a sigh of relief after receiving something of a reprieve from credit rating agency S&amp; P Global Ratings thanks to SA s large and active fixed income market and local authorities commitment to gradual fiscal consolidation .The agency held SA s foreign currency sovereign credit rating at BBB- the lowest investment-grade rating and kept its outlook negative.S&amp; P cut its local currency rating however which it had widely been expected to do. It was the only one of the three agencies that had a discrepancy between the local and foreign currency ratings. It cut it by one notch to BBB.S&amp; P was the last of the big three agencies to make an announcement in this round of rating reviews and was the most important because it was the only agency that had SA s foreign currency rating one notch above junk with a negative outlook meaning it was the most likely to downgrade SA to junk.In the lead-up to the decision analysts were saying the decision on the foreign currency rating was too close to call.A week ago Fitch kept its BBB- rating on SA but changed its outlook from stable to negative. Moody s issued a research report instead of a rating decision in effect maintaining the rating at two notches above junk with a negative outlook without actually affirming it.But it issued a warning to SA to get its messy politics sorted out.In a statement issued by the CEO Initiative it said: The business community welcomes the decision by S&amp; P to retain SA s sovereign credit rating at its current level. This means South Africa s long-term foreign currency debt is rated as investment grade by all three major rating agencies. The chief economist of global research at Standard Chartered Bank Razia Khan said the country had once again been reprieved but much more interest in the local currency rating cut was likely. While this still leaves South Africa s local currency rating safely in investment grade territory the implicit warning is clear in S&amp; P s assessment reform to date has been piecemeal gross debt-to-GDP is set to peak at a higher level and more needs to be done. The pace of South Africa s growth remains a key ratings weakness. She said it was difficult to put a positive gloss on this although the markets were probably already pricing in at least some risk of a downgrade. The rand may rally in a knee-jerk fashion in the very near-term but the choice of ratings action suggests that concerns were very significant. Unless more structural reform was seen and more was done to boost growth SA was still at risk of losing its investment grade rating. The reprieve may well be temporary. It s not enough on its own to calm fears around the eventual loss of investment grade status she concluded.Local currency ratingAlthough the local currency rating was not the decision that had everyone one edge it is significant because it covers the rand-denominated bonds that the government issues in the domestic market about a third of which are owned by foreign investors.Downgrades to this rating could affect capital flows to SA especially given that SA s domestic bonds are included in a key international bond index. But in S&amp; P s case the local rating is still in the investment grade tier.S&amp; P said on Friday that SA s institutions such as the judiciary were strong and the independence of the Reserve Bank remained intact.The decision on the foreign currency rating means SA has again narrowly escaped being relegated to the sub-investment grade zone after avoiding that danger six months ago and a year ago.A downgrade to junk is a potential catastrophe as it would oblige many fund managers to pull their funds.It can set off a downward spiral blocking much-needed investment and making it more expensive for the government to borrow money at a time when the fiscus is under pressure from lower revenue collection as a result of slow economic growth.It is possible but very difficult for a country to claw its way back from a junk rating.Only six of 20 countries cut to junk by S&amp; P over the past three decades have regained investment-grade ratings and that took them between 13 months and more than 11 years to achieve data compiled by Bloomberg show. Rand Merchant Bank research shows the typical recovery takes about 7.5 years.SA now has another chance to avoid having to do that.The Treasury said in a statement it welcomed the decision by S&amp; P and this was as a result of working together as South Africans to ensure that the country remains an investment grade . While we have strengths as a country we also have weaknesses that we are and will continue to address as government to achieve our common goal of reducing inequality poverty and unemployment it said.The Treasury said that together with business labour and civil society government remained committed to improving investor and consumer confidence through fast-tracking the implementation of structural reforms on growth.At 7.58pm the rand had strengthened to R13.79 to the dollar from Thursday s R14.09 and Friday s worst intraday level of R14.17.
