Former first lady Graca Machel got tongues wagging with a comment she made about the government at the opening of the Nelson Mandela Children s Hospital in Johannesburg.On Friday Mandela s widow thanked all who had contributed their time and resources to make the hospital a reality saying it was a monument to Mandela s love and care for children.Machel then singled out the efforts of Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi sneaking in what some considered to be a jab at the government. The government of South Africa and in this case we will say minister Motsoaledi thank you so much. First for having understood the nature of this hospital. There were very many people who fought the idea of the hospital but the minister was very very clear and from the onset had been a champion of the children s hospital. We hope that you will continue to mobilise your colleagues in that government to continue to support this initiative. Machel said that while some of Motsoaledi s colleagues in government had called the hospital as a facility for the elite its beauty and expertise should serve as an example for all paediatric units across the country. Machel also said that the hospital s services should not benefit only South African children but all from countries in the region.Twitter users were quick to react accusing Machel of throwing shade.Thandeka on TwitterLuzuko Mngqibisa on Twitter Motsoaledi is believed to be one of the senior ANC members who supported a motion for President Jacob Zuma to step down during a heated national executive committee meeting at which party leaders debated his fitness to hold office.
