It ll cost you at least R9-million to buy it and at least 12 staff to maintain it.The Gauteng government will hold a media briefing on Tuesday about the sale of a multimillion-rand mansion meant to house the premier of the province which will not be used by David Makhura. The house is being auctioned for around R9-million and is part of several immovable assets being disposed from the provincial asset register.Built in the suburb of Bryanston Johannesburg the house which will go under the hammer of Tirhani Auctioneers is on 3700 square metres of land and has a 25m-long swimming pool with two separate entertainment areas on each side.One area is a braai area where food can be prepared and the other a living area which is Wi-Fi-enabled with surround sound and comfortable seating. Underneath the pool is a massive boardroom with a table for 30 people its own kitchen and bathrooms. This area alone is 420 square metres.When sitting next to the pool the house provides a scenic view stretching as far as Kempton Park Sandton Auckland Park and all the way to Centurion.From the pool are beautiful lawns leading to the covered party section which feeds into four air-conditioned living rooms also with Wi-Fi. Not far from one of the living rooms is a small indoor garden which has direct sunlight coming through the roof of the house.There is enough garaging to accommodate about six vehicles and space outside for 30 more. There are five en-suite bedrooms. There is a three-bedroom duplex attached to the house with its own bathroom and kitchen.The main kitchen is fitted with a commercial grade cold room and there is also a wine and whiskey cellar. The main bedroom comes with a study his and hers walk-in closets a storage area for shoes and clothes jacuzzi and a huge balcony. It takes 12 staff working on the property to keep it sparkling clean.The house is one of 1000 properties being auctioned by the provincial government.In October the province revealed that more than 1000 properties would be auctioned which the government felt would help reduce costs.The property on Eccleston Crescent was bought by the provincial government from a French businessman in 2004 for R11.4-million. An additional R4-million was spent on renovations and repairing structural defects .Makhura has not stayed at the official residence despite millions of rand being spent on it during the time of his predecessor now Water Affairs and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokanyane.Among the assets to be auctioned by provincial government are 31 land parcels 28 of which are vacant land and three that have dwellings (that are unoccupied).The department assigned a consortium including Ernst &amp; Young to help develop an accurate asset register.In March a report was tabled before the portfolio committee on infrastructure development that laid bare how the department had struggled under Qedani Mahlangu and Nandi Mayathula-Khoza to account for the immovable assets of the provincial government.A group of residents in Randhart Alberton on the East Rand claimed that the department demanded that they sign a lease that would force them to pay market-related rents for their occupancy of provincial properties.The portfolio committee found that the tenants would be willing to pay the higher rates if the department maintained their houses.
