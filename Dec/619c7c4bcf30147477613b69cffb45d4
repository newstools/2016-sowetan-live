Thuso Phala has fond memories of the Telkom Knockout, having never been on the losing side in the final.Ten years ago, as a promising 20-year-old at Silver Stars, Phala lifted the trophy thanks to a convincing 3-1 victory - over Ajax Cape Town - which was inspired by a Simba Marumo first-half hat-trick. It was Phala's first cup final as a professional but he says there was no pressure on him at all."We were not playing a big team and there were not a lot of fans. So there was just that excitement that I was playing in my first PSL cup final," he recalled.A decade later, aged 30, Phala has won the Knockout two more times, with Kaizer Chiefs in 2007 and SuperSport two years ago.During the latter final in 2014, Phala scored the winning goal in extra time as Matsatsantsa-a-Pitori beat his former side Platinum Stars at Orlando Stadium.The Soweto-born midfielder is relishing the challenge of playing in another final against Cape Town City on Saturday (Peter Mokaba Stadium, 6pm).The spotlight may be on the likes of Thabo Mnyamane and Reneilwe Letsholonyane, who are on form but Phala is also ready to play a key role like he did two years ago at Orlando."It is good that once in a while you are out of the media spotlight. It puts less pressure on a player. I've been in cup finals before and it is a big occasion for me to get a goal."Hopefully, I'm going to show up because this is a big stage for a player to shine," he said.Phala, though, admitted that City may be a small club, but still there is pressure to beat them."The thing is we are playing a small team, but they are on top of the log and that says a lot about them," he said."For a new team, they've been doing well and obviously there is that excitement. They look like they are going to be league contenders, because they have a strong attack."But their defence is not as solid compared to their attack, so that is something we must capitalise on."
