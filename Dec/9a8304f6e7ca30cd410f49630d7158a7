Kaizer Chiefs supporters have run out of patience and want Steve Komphela to vacate the hot seat, but the coach believes he still has the club's management on his side despite the team's horrible run of form.Missiles thrown by frustrated supporters at FNB Stadium flew across Komphela's face after Amakhosi were held to a 1-1 draw by in-form Cape Town City on Tuesday.It was Chiefs' fourth draw in six matches at home, and fifth overall, this season.Komphela, however, hinted that he will not succumb to the pressure from supporters to resign as Kaizer Motaung backs him. Chiefs are just four points behind leaders City and the beleaguered coach believes he can somehow turn things around for a team devoid of confidence."With regards to how things are at Naturena, there's always support, always. They [club bosses] understand the challenges we are going through because our team is about results and I do enjoy that support," said Komphela."It's important to accept realities of modern life. I am sure I am not the first person to have some submissions made or remarks, not only in sports but everywhere and even politically. You can hear what's happening, but you have to be strong enough to focus because you have a job to do."Amakhosi keeper Itumeleng Khune walked off the pitch with a spasm and is a doubt for Chiefs' league clash against Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday."The Itu substitution was forced. He had a spasm. He still needs to be checked," said the coach.
