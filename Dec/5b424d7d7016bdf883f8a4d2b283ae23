On paper Thabiso "The Rock" Mchunu should have enough in his armoury to dethrone WBO cruiserweight champion Aleksandr Usyk from the Ukraine at the Forum in Los Angeles, in the early hours of Sunday.That is based on the experience which Mchunu, from Pietermaritzburg, has gained in his 111 rounds in 19 fights.The KwaZulu-Natal warrior - who is trained in Johannesburg by Sean, George and Peter Smith - has 17 wins and two losses while Usyk has 10 wins from as many bouts.Mchunu, 28, has also fought better opposition in his career, including "Fast" Eddie Chambers and Ilunga "Junior" Makabu while Usyk's recognised opponent is Krzysztof Glowacki who he beat for the WBO belt in September.Glowacki, of Poland, had been undefeated after 26 straight wins.The big question though is, were the two rounds that Mchunu fought in May against unknown Boniface Kabore of Burkina Faso enough to restore his confidence after he was KO'd in the 11th round by Makabu in their WBC cruiserweight elimination bout in May last year?South African light heavyweight champion Ryno "The Lion" Liebenberg - who sparred with Mchunu for the up coming fight - said: "Thabiso is awkward and has skills and power. It is doable but it is not going to be easy."He is fighting an absolutely phenomenal fighter. Thabiso must pull out the fight of his life. It is mission possible."Usyk - a 2012 Olympic champion - turned professional in 2013. He gained recognition at the expense of local fighters - Daniel Bruwer (TKO 7), Danie Venter (TKO 9) and Johnny Muller (TKO 3). Mchunu outpointed Bruwer over 12 rounds and knocked out Venter in five rounds.The WBO has appointed neutral officials. Lou Moret from Los Angeles will be the referee while Jonathan Davis of the Philippines, Mexican Levi Martinez and Kermit Bayless of Las Vegas will be the judges.Genaro Rodriguez from Chicago will be fight supervisor.The bout between Mchunu and Usyk will deputise for the WBC International light heavyweight championship between defending champion Joe Smith Junior and Bernard Hopkins.Hopkins, 52, a former multiple world champion, will be involved in his last boxing match.
