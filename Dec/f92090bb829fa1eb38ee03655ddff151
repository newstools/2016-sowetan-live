Thapelo Morena has earned himself a couple of nicknames since he started playing at right back for Mamelodi Sundowns."Keke [Hlompho Kekana] calls me Cafu [Brazil's former World Cup-winning captain]. He started calling me Cafu from the first game I played as a right back against Polokwane City," said Morena."I used to watch Dani Alves at Barcelona and a lot of people are calling me that, even in newspapers. I look at how they play and position themselves and learn."To be called Cafu or Alves means Morena is doing a good job as a full back, switching from the right wing position he played at Bloemfontein Celtic. He has not struggled to fit in and is proving to be a menace for the opposition whenever he goes forward."It's not difficult to play there because in my first season at Celtic, I played at right back. I know the role," said Morena, who admits that he sometimes forgets his defensive duties."Sometimes I think like an attacking player, so I forget my responsibilities [at the back]. But the coach sat with me and showed me clips so that I can see where to improve."The 23-year-old, who is in Japan with Sundowns to take part in the Fifa Club World Cup, recently played in the 2-1 victory over Kaizer Chiefs, a club his father supports. But his old man was not too upset because his son was on the winning side."I always say my parents support 'Mamelodi Chiefs'. They support Chiefs, but every time I play they support me. Before we played Chiefs, I told my father that we are going to win 2-1 and he laughed."Before the game he called and he said 'I have a feeling Chiefs is going to lose' and that's what happened. He was happy that I was part of the game. He's always motivating me," said Morena.
