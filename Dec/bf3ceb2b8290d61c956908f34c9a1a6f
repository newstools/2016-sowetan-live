In spite of occupying their seats at Banyana Banyana on interim basis, coach Desiree Ellis and her deputy Maud Khumalo remain committed to the cause for the advancement of women football in the country.The two - and a few national team players - hardly had a rest on their return from the just-ended CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon as they headed straight to the Sasol National League Championship that started in Mossel Bay, Western Cape, on Tuesday.Safa is yet to make any pronouncement on the Banyana coaching job since the post was left vacant by Vera Pauw after the Rio Olympics in August.However, Ellis and Khumalo are already on a scouting mission to lay the foundation of a competitive Banyana at 2018 Women's Africa Cup of Nations tournament where Fifa World Cup berths will be at stake."I'm not going to say no to the Banyana Banyana job," said Ellis."Myself and Maud are still babies when it comes to coaching but as an assistant coach I worked very hard and now I have to work 10 times more."The two are now overseeing a tournament involving nine provincial champions. The event at the local D'Almeida Stadium features 11 of the current Banyana Banyana squad members."Whenever you come to a tournament you always check if there are players who can add value to the national squad, not only to senior but junior as well."We already have Linda [Motlhalo] who is 18; Thembi [Kgatlana] is 19 and Amogelang Motau who is also 19. We need to build for 2018 [Afcon]."Motlhalo turns for Janine van Wyk FC (JVW), owned by the Banyana captain, while Kgatlana and Motau play for University of Western Cape. Despite a flurry of goals at the national championships, Ellis is not entirely satisfied with the standard of play."We need to improve the level of football. We can do so by getting our players in the big leagues and playing against the best."Day 2 results: City Lads 0, Kanatla 2; Celtic 10, Richmond 0.l Mothowagae is in Mossel Bay courtesy of Sasol
