The calmness in Ben Motshwari's voice is a clear sign Bidvest Wits are not pressing any panic buttons, despite two defeats on the trot in the league.There's still a long way to go in the season, but they run the risk of being bridesmaids again this season if they do not turn things around and start playing like a side good enough to win the Absa Premiership title.Wits, who visit Golden Arrows at Princess Magogo Stadium today (7.30pm), missed quite a few of their stars due to injury and suspension in their defeats to SuperSport United and Cape Town City. You'd think with depth in their squad, the Clever Boys would not feel the absence of some of their key players.But they did and this should be a concern for coach Gavin Hunt."We are not panicking, but if we really want to win the league this season, we need to win our games starting against Arrows. We need to forget about the last two defeats and focus on the next game," said Motshwari."We lost a couple of guys who were playing regularly because of injury and suspension. It changed the team a bit. Most of the guys are back now- [Sifiso] Hlanti, Tyson [Thulani Hlatshwayo] and Xola Mlambo are back."I am not saying the other guys who played in their absence did not perform, but the guys who are back are people who were doing well for the team."Arrows have gone three matches without a victory in the league, but they cannot be taken for granted. They've lost only once at home this season."Arrows are a speedy team. They have guys like [Lerato] Lamola and [Kudakwashe] Mahachi. They are good on the counter attack, especially if they breakthrough on the sides," warned Motshwari, adding that Wits have been perfecting their finishing at training.
