Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt says they have let themselves down in the last three games and must be brave enough to fight back.The Clever Boys have lost two of their last three games against SuperSport United (0-2) and Cape Town City (2-3), while drawing the other one against Highlands Park.For a team that normally defends well, Wits have conceded a shocking seven goals in the three games, picking up a single point.They were without their trusted defenders Buhle Mkhwanazi and Thulani Hlatshwayo in the last two games. Mkhwanazi is out for the rest of the year following facial surgery after being kicked in the face in a clash against Highlands last month.Hlatshwayo sustained a finger injury during an attempted robbery recently."Buhle got his face kicked, so he won't play again this year and Tyson [Hlatshwayo], I don't know. Maybe his finger is still sore," Hunt said.He admitted that he was concerned that things have taken a turn for the worse after a good start, but has urged his charges to bounce back immediately."We have let ourselves down in the last three games. You got to be brave and stand up to make sure we play well from there."Hunt insisted, though, that Wits have played well despite not getting the results and is confident they will return to form."I will always be honest when we deserved to lose. Cape Town City didn't deserve to beat us and Highlands Park was the same."SuperSport United certainly didn't deserve to beat us, but they did," he said.Wits are currently third on the PSL table and their next match is against Golden Arrows, who are sixth, on December 14 at Princess Magogo Stadium."We can't become a bad side overnight," Hunt added.
