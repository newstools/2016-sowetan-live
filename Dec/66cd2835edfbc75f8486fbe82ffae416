American actor Danny Glover on Thursday night reminisced about the hope South Africans had in 1994 leading up to the country s historic democratic elections.It had been his first time in the country and he visited different provinces including the Western Cape Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.Glover said he had watched as a number of South Africans joined long queues filled with hope.He was addressing a National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa gala dinner which followed the union s 10th national congress in Cape Town on Thursday.He said during that time there was extraordinary hope not only for South Africa but for the rest of the world. It s always been the centre of that discourse the centre of that discussion for freedom self determination and liberation. South Africa has been that he said.He said the Freedom Charter was a document which united South Africans to topple apartheid and Numsa could still use it to champion the way forward for the country 22-years after democracy.Speaking about his own country he decried the election of Donald Trump in the US whom he described as a misogynist racist and a xenophobe and a threat to social movements.He said the election of Trump was an example of white hysteria and already LGBT communities living in the country s capital Washington DC were under threat.Glover called on Numsa to stand with students who stood up and fought for increases in university tuition fees.He said Numsa was building a revolution similar to the Cuban revolution led by former leader Fidel Castro. (You must) empower the working class so that they can take control of their own lives he said.He said the the working class wanted not ideology but things that could help them better their lives.
