What do former and current Banyana Banyana players like Portia Modise, Janine van Wyk, Nompumelelo Nyandeni, Amanda Dlamini and Noko Matlou have in common?They have all played over 100 matches each for Banyana and unfortunately, they haven't won a major trophy with the team.Banyana have competed in 11 CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations since 1995 and finished runners-up four times, having played second fiddle to the likes of Nigeria. On Friday, they lost 0-1 to Ghana to finish fourth at this year's championship in Cameroon, which Nigeria won yet again.Tiyani wa ka Mabasa looks at how Banyana can rise above their usual predictability and be real champions:Establish a professional leagueEx-Banyana player Jabulile Baloyi told the Sowetan a few months ago that this will work provided each province makes up a squad that will play on a regular basis. One of Nigeria's most popular football journalists, Colin Udoh, said they were blessed with talented players and mentally up to the challenge, but having a professional league in their country has made a big difference. "I think it is both a talent thing and a mental one . beyond that however, we have a league that runs year round despite funding challenges," he said.Introduce younger playersWithout taking anything away from the likes of Van Wyk, who has 141 caps, she has played in six AWCONS and the team didn't win any of them. The same goes for players like Matlou and Nyandeni. It should be worrying that there were only two real youngsters in the team that played in Cameroon - Amogelang Motau (19) and Thembi Kgatlana (20), while many are 25 or older. More needs to be done to identify younger players to take the team forward and hopefully qualify for the 2019 Fifa Women's World Cup to be hosted by France.Form a coaches' associationBaloyi also pointed out that there are many qualified women coaches who played for Banyana and know the challenges that the team has faced or continues to face, but the biggest problem is they are working in isolation.
