Former SA Reserve Bank governor and labour minister Tito Mboweni has evidently fallen victim to ATM sharks.He was apparently conned out of his bank card and had R5 000 withdrawn from his account by an ATM card thief on Thursday afternoon.He warned on his Twitter account: Be alert at the ATMs at Shell and Caltex Petrol stations N1 Midrand. Just been duped and lost my card and ten minutes later R5k withdrawn. This was followed by: There is an ATM thug operating there. He looks like a perfect gentleman bold head smartly dressed and seemingly very helpful. Be warned! To which well-known journalist and anti-crime campaigner Yusuf Abramjee responded: These criminals are active at many ATMs. CWP@Limbo73 tweeted: Sounds like the people who run #SABC etc. Most people on social media were sympathetic to the former politician s plight. However one social media user was perhaps not as kind.Lionel Swarts@LionelSwarts tweeted: Ja ne Being ex-governor does not mean you re the sharpest tool. Tabi T. Tabi @tabitabe had some advice for the former SARB governor: Sir rule is don t let no one get close to you while at the ATM. It s a way to distract you swap cards and still pin code.
