Pursue Hlaudi Motsoeneng for all costs and funds that the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has lost unlawfully under his leadership a former board member said on Tuesday morning.Krish Naidoo in an interview with Radio 702 decried the lack of good corporate governance at the public broadcaster after testimony of a number questionable decisions made by Motsoeneng when he was the SABC s chief operating officer was given in Parliament on Monday.Naidoo who had announced his resignation from the SABC board during a sitting of the portfolio committee on communications in October said pursuing Motsoeneng for the losses would set an example for other state-owned entities.He blamed Motsoeneng s questionable decisions on a consequence of the history of the board where you have two groups some of us were quite keen on ensuring good corporate governance and the others had some other agendas .Naidoo added: The majority of the board supported him in various actions that he did gave him the freedom that he wanted in breach of possibly every rule of law probably every rule of good corporate governance. He said that with hindsight it was good that these revelations were emerging as this would not just to help us fix the SABC and put it on a more sustainable path but it would also be setting a form of benchmark for all state-owned entities throughout the country . What I think should happen after this whole debacle is to pursue Mr Moetsenseng for all costs and funds that we were taken out the SABC unlawfully and this should set a tone for other individuals who are probably doing the same thing at other state-owned entities. Naidoo claimed that as a board member he was unaware of the issues at the SABC. As board member non-executive board members these matters never ever came up to board level they would have probably surfaced at management level and either (been) oppressed at that level or dealt with at that level. So as board members I am hearing this for the first time yesterday. Rescuing the SABC Naidoo said required stringent political oversight and setting rules of corporate governance and to manage and police those rules .Naidoo had resigned from the board along with Vusi Mavuso in October during a parliamentary portfolio committee hearing into the broadcaster s decision to give a new senior job group executive of corporate affairs to Motsoeneng after a court ruling that his appointment as chief operating officer was unlawful.When the SABC board accused the portfolio committee of bias Parliament instead established a new ad hoc committee to probe the SABC s board fitness to hold office.The sole remaining board member chairperson Prof Mbulaheni Maghuve has been summons to appear before that committee on Tuesday after missing his scheduled appearance last Thursday.
