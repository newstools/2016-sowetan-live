The Tubatse/Fetakgomo municipality in Limpopo is unable to properly perform its tasks as part of its vehicle fleet has been attached.Municipal spokesman Kubane Tolo on Tuesday confirmed operations of the municipality had been affected."But we were able to stabilise our traffic unit which was deeply affected by the seizure of the fleet," Tolo said.Mphaphuli Consulting obtained a warrant of execution after the municipality failed to pay more than R40-million it owed the company.Mphaphuli was appointed by the Greater Tubatse Municipality in 2013 to electrify several villages, with the initial amount of the contract being R168-million.Due to an addendum on the contract and an addition to the villages to be electrified, the amount increased to R326-million.However, the municipality abruptly terminated the contract accusing the company of not doing some of the contracted work.Mphaphuli director Lufuno Mphaphuli said he took the matter to court to challenge the municipality's decision.An order was granted by the Polokwane High Court on October 25 ordering the municipality to pay an amount of R41184311.45 to the company.The order was not adhered to, resulting in Mphaphuli engaging the services of the sheriff of the court. The sheriff notified the municipality on November 18 of the execution order and gave it until December 9 to respond.The municipality had not done so by the given deadline.On Monday, the mayoral car, a Range Rover, was attached.More attachments took place yesterday.According to sheriff of the court Elias Mohlala, they attached 18 cars, including five graders, a truck and six cars used by traffic officers.He said they were valued at about R48-million."A municipal account was also attached, but from what I heard, the municipality is busy making arrangements to pay all the costs," Mohlala said.He said the municipality had 21 days from which to settle the payments "failing which we will have to sell the properties".Tolo said the municipality had launched an urgent application with the court "because we still maintain that we do not owe the service provider and we want him to come back to the site and finish the job so that we can pay him what is due to him".frankm@sowetan.co.za
