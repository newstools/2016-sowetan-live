The rebirth of the "CBD" and the scintillating form of Percy Tau gives Pitso Mosimane reason to believe Sundowns can go to the Fifa Club World Cup, leave a mark and retain the Absa Premiership.With a top squad like the one he has, Mosimane cannot be blamed for being so confident of conquering domestic football again, even though they will fall further behind in matches."We are going to be in a difficult position. We need to play catch-up and it's more pressure and stress because people have points. We have to win. But what do I see? I think the same as last year. I believe we will win it (league)," said Mosimane after Sundowns' 4-1 victory over Free State Stars at Loftus on Saturday.The African champions leave for the Club World Cup in Japan today. Mosimane's men open their campaign on Sunday against the winner between Auckland City and Kashima Antlers. These two clubs will face off in a quarterfinal play-off match on Thursday.Mosimane says he would be happy to reach the semifinals, but TP Mazembe and Raja Casablanca have previously proven that African teams can reach the final. Mazembe were beaten 3-0 in the final by Inter Milan in 2010 and Raja went down 2-0 to Bayern Munich at the same stage three years ago to win silver medals."We are representing Africa and I will be happy if we reach the semifinals. I will be happy to see an African team finishing third in the competition."Against Stars on Saturday, Tau bagged a brace and the rout was completed by goals from Khama Billiat and Keagan Dolly. Leonardo Castro, the final puzzle of the CBD [Castro-Billiat-Dolly], deserves credit for creating two goals.
