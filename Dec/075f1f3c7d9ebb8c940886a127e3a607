The 2017 intake at the University of the Witwatersrand allows for 6 200 first year students and the successful candidates will hear if they are accepted after their Matric pass rates are announced.The university is looking forward to next year s academic year after concluding its examinations for 2016 despite being at the forefront of the #FeesMustFall protests. Supplementary and deferred examinations will be written in December and January depending on the faculty. We have received almost 70 000 applications for 6 200 first year places and all applications have already been processed. Firm offers will be made once matriculation results are announced. We continue to process postgraduate applications says Professor Adam Habib Wits Vice-Chancellor and Principal. Habib said this season s graduation ceremonies at Wits University will run from the 6th to the 13th of December. Despite the disruptions experienced in September and October through extending the academic calendar and revising examination dates we effectively lost only three teaching days. We are pleased that the 2016 academic year has been concluded successfully. Habib added that he is hopeful a solution will be found in the coming weeks to the underfunding of the higher education sector and what essentially amounts to a national political problem that can only be solved at that level. The successful completion of the academic year under strenuous circumstances was no easy feat and would not have been possible were it not for the unwavering commitment of the University community including its students staff parents alumni donors and others who supported the University during this time he says. We thank each and every person who contribute to making Wits great.
