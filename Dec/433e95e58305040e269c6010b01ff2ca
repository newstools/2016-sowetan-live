The author of a controversial book Dear Jacob which portrays President Jacob Zuma as the biblical shepherd Jacob has written a book about the life of slain Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa.The book about the life of the late Orlando Pirates goalkeeper written by the young and versatile author Soweto Mandlanzi will be launched in March next year. This was revealed during the launch of Mandlanzi s book titled Life is a Trip during a glitzy ceremony in Umbilo Durban on Saturday which was attended by a host of celebrities.His latest book is about his life story which touches on various issues such as abstaining from drug abuse and alcohol and social responsibility. But in preparation for his next book on Meyiwa Mandlanzi has decided to honour him by looking back from where he came from.Meyiwa was shot and killed on October 26 in 2014 at age 27 during a suspected botched robbery at his girlfriend pop singer Kelly Khumalo s home in Vosloorus east of Johannesburg.No one has been arrested in connection with the murder that shocked the South African and the international soccer community despite the fact that there were seven witnesses to the incident. They include Khumalo her sister Zandi Zandi s boyfriend Longwe Thwala and two friends Mthokozisi Thwala and Tumelo Mandlala.In Dear Jacob Mandlanzi tries to capture Zuma s trials and tribulations ahead of Polokwane in 2007 and likens Jacob s conflict with this brother Esau to Zuma s relationship with former president Thabo Mbeki.But Christians consider the book blasphemous and the author was even threatened by those who were outraged at his comparison of Zuma to Jacob in the Bible because they were critical of the president s leadership.
