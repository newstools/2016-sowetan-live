Luyolo Nomandela is continuing his trials at Cape Town City although the club's fairytale run to the final of the Telkom Knockout will not have helped his cause.The 27-year-old wide player has a chance to revive his career after being given the boot by Mamelodi Sundowns in October.But Ajax Cape Town turned him down for being too fat and City are his second shot at getting back into action.City were in Johannesburg for two matches last week leaving Nomandela back in Cape Town to work out in the gym and training with the Multi Choice Diski team under Craig Rosslee.And this week coach Eric Tinkler is only working with the 20-man squad that he is taking to the Telkom Knockout final in Polokwane against SuperSport United on Saturday afternoon.City are training through the week before departing for Limpopo on Friday.Nomandela has been brought into the first team squad training session whenever City have been able to squeeze him in but he has not had much chance to show Tinkler what he can do.Nomandela was a late bloomer after spending the early part of his career in the SAFA Second Division and National First Division at hometown club Bush Bucks FC Buffalo and eventually Carara Kicks.His first season in the Premier Soccer League at Free State Stars in 2012/13 season was an immediate hit and just a year later he won two caps for Bafana Bafana scoring in a friendly against Burkina Faso at Soccer City.He moved to Sundowns after his first season in the top flight but never made the step up with the Brazilians and loan spells did nothing to enhance his reputation.His contact with Sundowns was eventually cancelled in October and he is now a free agent. - TMG Digital
