Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler has questioned the decision to play Saturday's Telkom Knockout final at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane.City face Supersport United in the tournament decider and Tinkler questioned the neutrality of the venue.The City coach revealed that he is not pleased with having to play the final at the Peter Mokaba Stadium where SuperSport won the Nedbank Cup against Orlando Pirates in May.It is also arguably the most challenging venue for the Cape Town team and their supporters to get to in the country. I don t know how neutral it is to be honest " Tinkler said."I m not entirely happy with the venue because I think it is difficult for us and our fans the trip we have to make to get there Tinkler said. Then we have the added problem of the fact that we play (a league game) on Tuesday evening [at home in Cape Town] against Platinum Stars."We can only leave [Polokwane] on Sunday and then we have to play SuperSport again on Friday [in Cape Town in the league]. SuperSport don t have another game the whole week so I m not too sure about the thinking there to be honest. - TMG Digital
