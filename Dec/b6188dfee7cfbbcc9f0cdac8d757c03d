More than 10,000 civilians have fled eastern parts of Aleppo in the past 24 hours for districts of the city under the control of Syria s government, a monitor said Monday.It takes to about 130,000 the number of civilians displaced since regime forces launched an offensive to retake the rebel-held east in mid-November, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Pro-government forces on Monday seized the Aleppo district of Sheikh Saeed, putting it in control of 90% of areas once held by the rebels, the Britain-based monitoring group said earlier.Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the advance has left some neighbourhoods of the battleground northern city empty of civilians.Syria s second city, Aleppo had been divided since 2012 between government forces in the west and rebel groups in the east.In less than a month, a blistering offensive by Syria s army and allied militia has overrun most of rebel territory in the city.
