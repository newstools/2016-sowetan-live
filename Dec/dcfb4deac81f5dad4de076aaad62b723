The Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) council has resolved to make changes to the constitution of the African National Congress (ANC) in order to close weaknesses in the organization.This comes as the former MK members held a council over the weekend in Nasrec Soweto where they also discussed the state of the its military veterans association (MKMVA) and the welfare of former combatants. We accordingly declared to call for a review of the ANC constitution. We are going to request a meeting to report on the council after the council adopted resolutions and recommendations that will be forwarded to and discussed with the leadership of the African National Congress said former MK General Siphiwe Nyanda.He was addressing members of the media after the senior and former MK members council at Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia on Monday. We will go back to the Secretary General of the ANC and the leadership of the ANC to present the suggestion because we believe there are resolutions that will seek to help the ANC to address the challenges that face it said Nyanda who also a former communications minister.Nyanda said that no individual was discussed at the council but rather the state of the organization and its structures. We are worried about the state of the African National Congress we are worried about the MKMVA and we are worried about the state of the ANC veterans league. The fact that the ANC is going through a period of crisis has necessitated this intervention added Nyanda.Thabang Makwetla who is a member of the MK steering committee said the ANC needed to take the interventions of former MK members seriously to address weaknesses in the party. Those challenges or factions in the organization have been with us for a while now... and those weaknesses seeks to among other things practices which allow for the abuse of members and the abuse of processes he said.The responsiveness of the leadership of the ANC to some of the sentiments within the organization is not adequate said Makwetla who is also the south minister of Justice and Correctional Services.The meeting with the ANC leadership will take place next year.
