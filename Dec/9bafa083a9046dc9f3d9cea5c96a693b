I don t understand why they re shifting around and making a noise when we are celebrating an African person he said. (Hlaudi) has helped transform the SABC to where it is today. He has changed the lives of the workers and he has changed the lives of the musicians said Maphatsoe.He said Motsoeneng was the calibre of person that was needed to be deployed in government institutions. We thought we should honour Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng while he was still alive and empowering musicians. Maphatsoe said Molefe and Myeni were of a similar calibre in their work to promote transformation in South Africa. She has also played a very important role to transform SAA Dudu Myeni is trying to transform SAA so South Africans can benefit (when doing business with the airline) he said. TMG Digital/The Times
