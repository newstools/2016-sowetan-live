Whether or not Mamelodi Sundowns win the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan, coach Pitso Mosimane wants the team to do well enough to start getting invites to play in pre-season competitions around the world.Mosimane wants Sundowns to earn the same respect they now have in Africa on other continents such as Asia, Europe, South and North America. European clubs are respected around Africa and are often invited, at a huge cost, to play pre-season matches on the continent. Mosimane wants Sundowns to earn that kind of respect on the big stage."It's important for Sundowns to play in this space. We are at an international level now, so I would like us to see us improving our pre-season programme. We must play at an international level during pre-season. This thing of playing Platinum Stars and others must change. Pre-seasons are in the US, Qatar and Dubai. We need to play in that space," said the former Bafana Bafana coach, who has previously taken Sundowns to Ghana, Namibia and Zambia for pre-season preparations."And the only way to be in that space is to go to the Club World Cup. People should not say 'who are you'? They must say 'we know that team'. You must be invited rather than beg teams to invite you. This is the only way we can put Sundowns at a high level. What's important is to always win the [domestic] league and compete in the Champions League."Sundowns arrived safely in Osaka, Japan, to start preparing for their opening Club World Cup match on Sunday. They will play the winner between Japanese side Kashima Antlers and Auckland City from New Zealand, who meet in the quarterfinal play-off match tomorrow."I don't know if I want the Japanese team to win it because they are at home. So, we would love to play Auckland City. But maybe after seeing the footage I will change my mind," said Mosimane.
