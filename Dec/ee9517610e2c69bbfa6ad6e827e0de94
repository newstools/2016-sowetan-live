Two overseas-based strikers not considered for recent Bafana Bafana squads have hit form in Europe in recent weeks bringing into stark reality the scoring troubles of the national side.Dino Ndlovu and Tokelo Rantie have both been lauded for recent performances but are unlikely to feature for the national side while Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba remains in charge.Both it would appear have lost interest in wearing the national team jersey while the current regime is in charge joining the likes of Kamohelo Mokotjo and Kermit Erasmus in semi-international retirement.Ndlovu scored a brace of goals for his Azerbaijan club Qarabag as they won a domestic cup fixture 5-0 against lowly S bail.It followed a crucial winner in a top-of-the-table league clash against Qabala in midweek that lifted his club to the summit of the table.That is now six goals in 12 starts for Ndlovu with his team and 24 goals in 38 starts since the beginning of last season if you include his time at Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta.No other South African striker can come close to matching that mark in the Premier Soccer League or European football yet Ndlovu s last appearance for the national team was in March 2014.He has been called up by Mashaba but not given a chance on the pitch.Rantie broke his duck at Turkish side Genclerbirligi last week when he netted the winner in a famous cup victory for his team away at giants Fenerbahce.That was his first club goal in more than two years.He has now followed that up with another in the league as Genclerbirligi won 2-0 at bottom side Adanaspor on Sunday the first time he has scored in back-to-back club games since June 2013 while at Swedish side Malmo.Meanwhile it was a barren weekend for some Bafana players who have enjoyed recent call-ups.Andile Jali (KV Oostende) Lars Veldwijk (Kortrijk) and Ayanda Patosi (Lokeren) all did not feature for their sides for various reasons the latter having struggled with passport problems that delayed his return from international duty last month.Having made the bench last weekend Bongani Zungu was left out of the match day squad by Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes while Erasmus was also dropped from the 18 for French Ligue 1 side Rennes.Mokotjo continued his strong season by playing for FC Twente in their 0-0 Dutch league draw at Willem II while Bafana target Joel Untersee played for Italian second-tier side Brescia in their 1-0 loss at Ternana.Daylon Claasen returned from six weeks out through injury to play for German Bundesliga II side 1860 Munich and Lebogang Phiri came off the bench for Danish club Brondby as they drew 1-1 at Ebsjerg.Finally Steven Pienaar was replaced at halftime as Sunderland won a third game in four with a 2-1 English Premier League victory over Leicester City. - TMG Digital
