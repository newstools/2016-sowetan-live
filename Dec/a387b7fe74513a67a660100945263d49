Sri Lanka made a solid start to what would be a record run chase to win the first test against South Africa at St George s Park on Thursday.The Lankans were 27 without loss at lunch in their second innings on the fourth day in search of a target of 488 - more than they have ever made in a fourth innings and more than has yet been scored in a fourth innings in South Africa.The home side resumed their second innings on 351/5 and Faf du Plessis and Quinton de Kock batted on for 11.5 overs before the declaration came.South Africa s captain Du Plessis called a halt to the innings even as television umpire Rod Tucker was adjudicating De Kock s challenge to being given out leg-before to Rangana Herath.Both Du Plessis and De Kock had left the field by the time Bruce Oxenford who had given De Kock out originally was able to raise his finger in confirmation.South Africa declared on 406/6 with Du Plessis unbeaten on 67 and De Kock out for 69.Their partnership of 129 was the highest in a match in which all four century stands have been shared by South Africans.The closest South Africa came to claiming their first wicket in Sri Lanka s second innings was when Kaushal Silva edged Kagiso Rabada between wicketkeeper De Kock and first slip Hashim Amla in the third over before lunch. - TMG Digital
