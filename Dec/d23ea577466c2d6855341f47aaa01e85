The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) hopes its perjury charge against former SA National Roads Agency (Sanral) CEO Nazir Alli will serve to deter leaders of state-owned entities from behaving as a law unto themselves in the future .Outa said its consultant John Clarke had laid the charge against Alli at the Linden police station on Friday December 16.The case relates to Alli s handling of the proposed tolling of national roads in the Western Cape particularly his declaration in a sworn statement dated 2 October 2014 stating that the Sanral board had passed a resolution in 2004 to declare sections of the N1 and N2 in the Western Cape as toll roads . An Outa statement said that Alli could not produce minutes of the board meeting to prove that the any such resolution was taken prior to the 2008 gazetting of the roads as toll roads .It added that then Transport Minister Jeff Radebe signed off on the declaration without evidently applying his mind or being aware that the Sanral board had not exercised its fiduciary duty to pass a resolution . The City of Cape Town applied to the Western Cape High Court to have the declaration as toll roads set aside and in September 2015 it found that Alli s assertion that the board had passed the requisite resolution to be so far-fetched as to be untenable .It was this that saw the toll road declaration being set aside and a year later the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed Sanral s appeal against the high court ruling. Said Outa s Wayne Duvenage: There is a worrying trend of state-owned institutions where senior executives flout the law so as to not act in the best interest of South Africa as a whole. Outa is committed to arrest this behaviour and will continue to root out the rot and pursue these matters in our courts where and as required. TMG Digital
