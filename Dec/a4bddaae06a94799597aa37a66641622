An ANC regional secretary in Limpopo was acquitted of rape and bribery charges.Victor "Tolly" Mashamaite, ANC Waterberg regional secretary, returned to his office in Mokopane for the first time in three weeks on Tuesday.He was accused of raping a 22-year-old woman and buying her silence with R400.On Monday, Mashamaite, 40, was found not guilty by the Mokopane Regional Court.He had been arrested on October 12.Mashamaite said although he was worried his name had been tarnished, he wanted to take legal action against his accuser ."I'm happy that my name has been cleared by the courts and that this happened prior to the forthcoming regional elective conference of the ANC scheduled to take place soon," said Mashamaite.He said he was also going to take action against the police for what he termed "unlawful" arrest."From the onset the cases brought against me smelt of politics and I have impressed it upon the ANC to investigate the matter to ensure that those behind this are exposed," he said.Mashamaite's lawyer, Mphafolane Koma, said he was happy his client was "free at last".Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they had played their part and that after Mashamaite was cleared by the court there was nothing they could do further.ANC spokesman in the Waterberg region, Billy Teffo, said they were looking forward to smooth working relations with Mashamaite."But we had always maintained that he was innocent and that Mashamaite's arrest was politically-motivated. We are happy that charges against him had been dropped," Teffo said.frankm@sowetan.co.za
