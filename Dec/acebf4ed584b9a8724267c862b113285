Ajax Cape Town s surprise win over champions Mamelodi Sundowns in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday has given the beleaguered club much-needed points but new coach Stanley Menzo says points must be taken more regularly from fellow strugglers.Menzo said three points taken off Sundowns in only their second win of the season for Ajax must be seen as a bonus. We have to be taking our points from the teams around us. We know we can t be challenging Sundowns but making sure we get the better of the teams around us in the log table is most important said Menzo in the glow of success after the unexpected 2-0 triumph.Ajax s successive wins over Platinum Stars and Sundowns moved them from bottom to third-last in the standings. It was an important win that has given confidence and a morale boost to the players. It was important for us to stay in the game and to play in the way we spoke about. We were up against a very good team but we knew the chances would come. I thought our work ethic was very good and I m very glad for the players. They deserved it. Menzo added: It was extra special to beat the league champions. It s not the end it s just the start. Ajax host Lamontville Golden Arrows next at the Athlone Stadium on Saturday night. We still have a lot to achieve but we are on a good track said the former Dutch national team goalkeeper.Menzo said he was happy with the passing game that Ajax exhibited but felt they were at too high a tempo. The fact that a few of our players had cramps meant we ran a lot. We need to keep the ball better he said. I saw Arrows when they played their last game against Sundowns but we must work on our way of playing. With all respect to our opponent my priority is for us to get our style right.
