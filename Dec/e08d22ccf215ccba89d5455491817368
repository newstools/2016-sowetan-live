Beating Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout does not mean SuperSport United will have it easy against Cape Town City in the final on Saturday.In fact, City will prove to be an even tougher test than Sundowns and Pirates for Stuart Baxter and his SuperSport side, considering the surprise packages are the in-form team with a coach and players who are hungry to succeed.What SuperSport can rely on, however, is their experience in cup finals. They've had good success in knockout competitions and this should give them an edge when they face Eric Tinkler's high-flying City side at Peter Mokaba Stadium [6pm]."Results from the past can help your confidence and belief, but they cannot help you on the day. We need to know that Cape Town City will be a difficult opponent and they are the team surprising everybody at the moment, although I am not surprised because they were fourth in the league last season [as Mpumalanga Black Aces]."We are preparing for a tough game," said Baxter, who beat Tinkler - a Pirates coach at the time - in the Nedbank Cup final in May."Eric is one of the young coaches [46] that's got a bright future. He's done a lot and I thought he did a good job with Pirates. And when you talk about the game, he knows what he is talking about and he's got a belief in what he is doing."In the Nedbank Cup final, Tinkler's Pirates side were let down by some poor defending and he's having that same problem at City, but they've been able to make up for it by getting the goals up front. Baxter will certainly target their shaky defence, especially during set pieces. SuperSport could have Jeremy Brockie back. Brockie trained with the team yesterday after a bad tackle by Pirates' Thabo Matlaba in the semifinal.
