Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana has praised his team mates for not suffering stage-fright and playing their own brand of football in the Fifa Club World Cup quarterfinal defeat against Kashima Antlers.The big defensive midfielder though did admit that Downs' glaring omission was a ruthlessness in taking their chances when they were dazzling Antlers with expansive, fluid passing football in the first half at Osaka's Suita City Football Stadium on Sunday.Sundowns now meet Asian champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in tomorrow's fifth-place play-off in Osaka (9.30am SA time)."We are really disappointed," Kekana said while Downs' clearly deflated players filed through the stadium press "mixed zone" after the game.Antlers may also have been tournament rookies, but Japan has hosted the Club World Cup seven times since its inception in 2000, and the country's clubs have taken part five previous times.That is a big difference from being the first Southern African team to participate at the tournament.Kekana, though, did praise his team for their bravery.Sundowns applied the same brand of exciting attacking football in the first half that took them to being PSL and African champions, a display that had international TV commentators purring, but had no end product."And to see yourself on this kind of stage where nobody had stage-fright is encouraging too," he added.Jeonbuk lost 1-0 to Mexico's Club America in Sunday's early quarterfinal.l Strydom is in Japan as a guest of Sundowns
