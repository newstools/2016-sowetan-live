Bloemfontein Celtic caretaker coach Lehlohonolo Seema is thankful to Orlando Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza for opening doors for him a decade ago.Seema joined Pirates from Celtic in July 2006 and the former defender says his journey from player to eventually coach became a lot more clearer when he became a Buccaneer.Celtic beat Pirates 2-1 at Orlando Stadium in a league match on Tuesday night and Seema who made 63 appearances for the Bucs says his former club will always have a special place in his heart."I will always remain humble and I am thankful for the opportunity that was given to me by Dr Irvin Khoza and the Orlando Pirates family to be there."I was able to show my talent as player and of course they gave me a platform to be a future coach after playing."And that is happening now."They've also contributed to where I am today and I am sure even them they are very happy to see me and say one of our players is now a coach."The student certainly became the master on Tuesday as Pirates coach Augusto Palacios was one of the mentors who moulded his career as a player during his time with the Bucs.The budding mentor and his co-coach John Maduka were asked by club management to take over on an interim basis after Serame Letsoaka was sacked in October.Seema returned to Orlando for the first time as a coach on Tuesday and beating Pirates away from home will have moved Celtic management a step closer towards appointing the increasingly formidable duo on a more permanent basis. - TMG Digital
