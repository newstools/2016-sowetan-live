Parents of pupils who used to attend the infamous Mpepule Primary School near Lephalale, Limpopo, expressed joy as their children passed with good grades this year.The pupils were moved to different schools after Mpepule, where they lived under horrific conditions, was shut down after a Sowetan expos .The provincial department of education closed the facility after learning that pupils, as young as five years old, were living in the school, sleeping in two classrooms and getting food that was not nutritionally balanced. Two pupils were bitten by snakes.But parents were not happy with the decision to close the school as they wanted their children to continue as a unit and not be split up and sent to other schools in the area.Roads to the school on a farm at Overyssel, 90km east of Lephalale, were impassable. A total of 142 pupils and their five teachers slept at the facility.Teachers took turns to go home on weekends and pupils only visited their home s once a month .Catherine Matsieng, a parent whose two daughters were admitted at Bangalong Primary School in Shongoane 3 village after the closure of Mpepule, said she was happy with the improvement in the performance of her children in class."When my two daughters started attending at Bangalong in April, their performance was nowhere near satisfaction. But after we approached teachers at the school to complain about the bad performance they listened and jerked up their performance," she said.The 32-year-old mother said her daughters, Betty and Sanna, had both passed their Grades - 7 and 5 - respectively and were looking forward to the next grades in the new year."Though Mpepule still features prominently in our minds, I find solace in the fact that my children are performing better at the new school," she said.She further accused the provincial department of education of failing to fulfil its promise of finding an alternative school for the children.Matsieng was supported by Sinah Sepoloane, another mother whose son Kholo was admitted at Tshukudu Primary School."The department made a fool of us when it closed down Mpepule and promised to find an alternative school for our kids."We still want that school because it took good care of our kids when we went to work," said Sepoloane.Mapula Molekwa, who was chairwoman of the school governing body at Mpepule, said they were planning to stage a sit-in in the offices of education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe, in Polokwane to demand a school for their children."We still want those pupils to be together in the same school and what the department has done is to deprive our children of the good teachers at Mpepule," said Molekwa.Approached yesterday, department spokesman Naledzani Rasila said he had nothing to say because as far as he was concerned Mpepule no longer existed."The pupils have been admitted in other schools, period," he said.Teachers were also moved to different schools in the province.frankm@sowetan.co.za
