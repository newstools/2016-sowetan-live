There was no growth in expenditure made by private sector and state-owned enterprises on corporate social investment (CSI) a report revealed on Tuesday.Companies and state-owned enterprises in South Africa spent R8.6-billion in total on social development in the country in 2015/16 representing a 6% increase in nominal growth from the previous year. This growth is in line with inflation over the review period reflecting zero growth in real terms. This according to Trialogue s annual research into expenditure on and approaches to corporate social investment (CSI) in South Africa. The research company found that since 2013 the total annual estimated CSI expenditure was growing in real terms.However in the past two years CSI expenditure experienced negative growth in real terms. CSI declined by 2% in 2014 and by 6% in 2015 and has now flattened to zero real growth. The top 100 companies invested R5.8-billion in CSI. This amounts to 68% of the total CSI expenditure. Fifteen companies tracked by Trialogue spent more than R100-million in 2015/16 together accounting for over half of the total amount spent by top 100 companies. The mining retail and financial services sectors together accounted for three-quarters of total CSI expenditure with mining alone accounting for over 30% of total CSI expenditure. Education received nearly half of CSI spend and was the most popular cause supported by over 90% of companies and receiving almost half of the total CSI spend (48%) up from 32% in 2010. Social and community development and health were the second and third most commonly supported sectors although support and expenditure for both declined marginally from 2015. Gauteng-based projects received the greatest share of CSI expenditure out of the provinces although the amount declined for a second year in a row to 19% in 2016 from a peak of 27% in 2014. Support for projects in Limpopo increased marginally while decreases in corporate support were noted for all other provinces.
