Maritzburg United have finally won two games in a row this season but caretaker coach Fadlu Davids has warned the team to keep their feet on the ground.The Team of Choice started the season well with victory in their first outing against Bloemfontein Celtic away, but have since been huffing and puffing, which led to Ernst Middendorp resigning last month and Davids taking over on an interim basis.Now, however, they have done what they failed to do all season - to win two consecutive matches (against Baroka and Orlando Pirates).This stands them in good stead for their last two matches of the year against Platinum Stars (Saturday, 3.30pm) away and Bidvest Wits on Tuesday, which will be played at Harry Gwala Stadium.Davids, though, has previously played the game and knows his players may become overconfident and would like them to remain grounded as they look to finish the year strongly."We should take each game as it comes and we can't be celebrating. Imagine you celebrate for the next three days and get hammered by Platinum Stars. They beat Cape Town City 4-0 in their last match and we have to keep our feet on the ground," Davids said.Dikwena, who have been struggling this season, will host this encounter at Royal Bafokeng Stadium and it is interesting that Davids previously played for them between 2005 and 2006 before he joined Maritzburg.Davids, therefore, will know the kind of atmosphere that awaits them in the North West."It is a long trip to Rustenburg and we know it will be 35 degrees, so we have to get the guys fresh," he said."You can say we are on a high, but so are they. They won 4-0 and it will be an interesting game," Davids added.
