The uMkhonto WeSizwe Military Veterans Association has been accused of expressing views that do not represent a united stance on certain matters concerning the African National Congress. The situation has arisen within the ANC where unavoidably now and again uMkhonto WeSizwe Military Veterans Association has been drawn into political issues confronting the ANC. Naturally the views that they express would not necessarily be the views of the broad community of former members of the uMkhonto WeSizwe because it s not everyone who is part of the MKMVA structures said General Siphiwe Nyanda.He was speaking at a media briefing on Monday in Rivonia Sandton flanked by other former MK senior commanders and commissars.Concerned commissars and commanders of UMkhonto WeSizwe will convene a council where all former MK members MKMVA ANC veterans as well as the party s top six will be invited to be part of the meeting which will take place on December 17 in Johannesburg.He said the ANC s leadership was aware of the challenges that are faced by UMkhonto WeSizwe and the need therefore for the conference to discuss these challenges. It is our expressed intention to make sure that MKMVA is making inputs and assisting the ANC in managing these political challenges it should benefit from the broadness and depth of the former UMkhonto WeSizwe community [that] the ANC has. This is what we are seeking to bring into the equation with respect to the challenges that we are talking about added Nyanda.He concluded that the MKMVA should not be used for anything else but to add an input into the ANC.
