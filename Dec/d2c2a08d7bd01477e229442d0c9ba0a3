As a student at North West University, Thabo Mnyamane told his friends that he would one day play in a cup final after watching the MTN8 final between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs as a spectator at FNB Stadium in 2011.Mnyamane, who was with Bidvest Wits midfielder Xola Mlambo at the stadium that day, prayed for his dream to come true. Now five years later, the 24-year-old is just a day away from playing in his maiden cup final as a professional.His SuperSport United side takes on Cape Town City in the Telkom Knockout final at Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Mlambo recently won his first piece of silverware with Wits. So Mnyamane is keen to follow in the footsteps of his friend by winning the trophy."I remember watching the MTN8. It was Pirates against Chiefs, when Oupa Manyisa scored [the winning goal]. The varsity football team was at the stadium. I said, 'one day I will be in a cup final'."I have dreamed of playing in a cup final and when your dream becomes a reality, it's good because it shows the work you have put in. I would like to put the icing on the cake and get a gold medal," he said.On current form, Mnyamane has the ability to put the icing on the cake for Matsatsantsa, who have beaten Mamelodi Sundowns and Pirates en route to the final. His confidence has grown, with a run of four goals in his last five matches."I'm happy, but personally, I would like to contribute more goals. It was not me alone because the team played a role."Mnyamane believes the relegation battle he went through with University of Pretoria last season has helped to make him a "fighter"."The relegation fight is not easy and it helped me grow as a player. Tuks' battle helped me to become a fighter."l See page 35
