Desiree Ellis firmly believes she is the right coach to take Banyana Banyana forward, if given more time at the helm.She was speaking after reaching the semi finals of the ongoing CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon.Despite the team's 1-0 to Nigeria on Tuesday, Ellis suggested she is capable of guiding Banyana to greater heights."I've only been Banyana coach since October 16, which is not a very long time. One needed to implement a few things, but it was within a short period of time," said the 52-year-old, who took over on interim basis after Vera Pauw vacated the coaching seat after the Rio Olympics in August."I hope everybody saw what we wanted to do, but it is not up to me to say I would be there [as permanent coach]. I'm only the interim coach now and the powers at home have to decide, but if given an opportunity, I will grab it with both hands."Ellis hinted that if she continued in the job, she would bring more young players into the setup."There are still a lot of players from our U20s and the U17s that went to the World Cup in 2010. A few young players are here, but there are still a lot at home. The aim was to win it, so you mix a little bit of experience and some youth. Hopefully over the next year or so, the team will evolve and the young players will come through," Ellis added.She has one more match to take charge before her fate is decided.Banyana meet Ghana in a bronze medal match in Yaounde on Friday.
