The Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, businessman in a legal battle with Vodacom over the airtime advance feature lost his South Gauteng High Court bid to force the mobile phone giant to pay him for his idea.Judge Colin Lamont dismissed John Khaba's lawsuit last week, saying it was poorly set out in his court papers. Last month, Lamont heard arguments.In his judgment, Lamont described Khaba's court papers as "convoluted" and "ramble lengthily as to fact and law and on the face of it they appear to be vague and embarrassing".Lamont did not deal with Khaba's lawsuit and said "the only issue is whether or not the plaintiff's (Khaba's) allegations disclose a cause of action".However, the judge appeared to agree with Khaba's advocate Dean Ehrlich, who told the court, that where there was no common law it should be developed."... It was submitted that there could be no exception to a situation which does not exist as the common law has not yet been developed. There seems to be some merit in the submissions."However, these issues do not arise, as there is no allegation that in the particulars of claim that the common law as it stands needs development," reads Lamont's judgment.Lamont said after disclosing his idea to Vodacom, Khaba was not the only person in possession of the idea.Khaba had demanded five cents of every rand Vodacom made from the product as compensation since its launch in May 2011.sidimbal@sowetan.co.za
