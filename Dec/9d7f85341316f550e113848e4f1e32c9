To avoid being under pressure on home soil, South Africa's under-20 team, Amajita, need an early goal in their Cosafa Cup semifinal against Angola at Moruleng Stadium today (5pm).This is the view of coach Thabo Senong, who wants his boys to control the game and not give Angola's dangerous full-backs a chance to get forward.Amajita hammered Lesotho 8-0 in their opening group A match, but they had to dig deep in their 1-0 victories over Swaziland and Botswana. The hosts did well to finish the group without conceding a goal and they'll need to focus at all times to stop an Angolan side capable of causing an upset. Angola only dropped points in a 1-1 draw with Mauritius in their final group match, but the work had already been done after their victories over Sudan and the Seychelles."They [Angola] have pace, are strong aerially and have strong full backs who overlap. That will bother us but we are preparing well to overload those areas to make sure we control the game," said Senong."It's important to score early, which we have been struggling to do in our last two games."Fransisco Sacalumbo and Felix Vladimiro are players Amajita need to look out for.They've scored four of Angola's six goals in the competition. Amajita's stars to watch are the likes of Luther Singh, Sibongakonke Mbatha and Menzi Ndwandwe.l Zambia will meet Democratic Republic Congo in the other semifinal tonight (7.30pm).
