Orlando Pirates coach Augusto Palacios will not tolerate players who don't follow instructions and will make changes for the side's last match of the year against Bloemfontein Celtic on Tuesday.The Bucs caretaker coach was fuming after his side lost 2-1 to Maritzburg United on Tuesday, their fourth game without a win. "If some players are not performing and as long as I stay here, I need to make changes. I cannot allow players at a professional stage [with] poor performance."There are supporters who are coming here to watch the game. I told the players before the game to look at the supporters," fumed the Peruvian."I think some of the players didn't put in the effort and it is wrong, very wrong."The Bucs faithful were incensed when midfielder Mpho Makola lost possession cheaply and demanded that he be taken off.However, Palacios refrained from pointing fingers. "I don't want to mention individual players but what I say is a player who knows what to do [but doesn't do it], then you have to give space to another one."I said before that you can't rely on names and you need to play a player who wants to play," he said.Pirates were caught off-guard by a quick free-kick that was converted by Bevan Fransman for Maritzburg.Palacios's other concern was that his side failed to take their chances in the first half.With the Celtic clash coming up on Tuesday, Palacios has promised to ring the changes.Palacios insisted the Buccaneers' season can be salvaged."We don't believe the chance to go to the top is lost, I don't think so."There are still a lot of points to play for, but we cannot be dropping points like this. I'm very disappointed because we were not supposed to lose [against Maritzburg]," he said.
