Glenda Watt who has achieved eight distinctions and the top aggregate at her school Durban Girls College has set her sights on a career in medicine. Although she was this year s dux she says she was happy and relieved when she saw her results. All IEB matriculants can check their exam results live at matric.sowetanlive.co.zaWatt who enjoyed all her subjects but kept a special place in her heart for Maths and Science said: My prelims were good but you still have to wait and see. Calling all matrics: claim your fame and you could win R6,000She comes from a strong academic family and has always been encouraged to do what she wanted to do. I m hoping to get into medicine at UCT she said. My father s a doctor and my sister studied medicine but I m not just following them. I enjoy the medical field and I think it is a great way to apply the theory and knowledge that I have acquired. The greatest challenge of the year was time management said Watts. Involved in sport and school activities she was also head of academic support a programme that offered peer support to girls struggling academically. I enjoyed helping other people particularly when you could see that they finally understood a concept. That was a good feeling. Durban Girls College has yet again achieved a 100% pass with results that are pretty similar to last year said academic director Margie Dwyer. We have four girls on the IEB top 5% list this year and 89% of our girls achieved A B and Cs. This is a marvellous result. TMG Digital/The Times
