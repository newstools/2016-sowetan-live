The man who allegedly stabbed a Soweto principal more than 30 times will spend Christmas behind bars.Oriah Molapo, 42, who is charged with attempted murder and malicious damage to property, abandoned his bail application in the Lenasia Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.This comes after the state added a new charge of fraud concerning his matric certificate and other qualifications.Last month, Molapo went to Paul Mosaka Primary School in Pimville and allegedly used a hammer to break principal Nothemba Lebepe's car window and repeatedly stabbed her with a knife.Sowetan reported then that Lebepe and Molapo were apparently in conflict for over 10 years, primarily over his qualifications.The Gauteng department of education confirmed that it had expelled Molapo last year over his bogus qualifications.Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe told Molapo that the cases before her were separate at the moment and that his defence had asked that they be consolidated, and that it (defence) would also make representation to the state with regards to the fraud case.Molapo's defence told the court that he would abandon his bail application pending investigation into both charges.Van der Merwe postponed the case to January 23.The courtroom was packed with Lebepe's supporters, mainly teachers wearing T-shirts with her face on them. There was also a handful of ANC Women's League members from Pimville.Molapo appeared calm and even smiled a bit with court officials.Speaking outside the court, Lebepe's husband Godfrey told Sowetan that his wife was discharged from hospital two weeks ago after spending about a week in ICU."Some days are good and some days are hectic, but she is making progress," Godfrey said.He said the family welcomed the court process of postponing the case again as the reasons were valid. "We are just happy he is behind bars where he belongs."Lebepe's supporters also said they were elated that he would spend Christmas behind bars and said they hoped he would not be granted bail even next year.Macupeb@sowetan.co.za
