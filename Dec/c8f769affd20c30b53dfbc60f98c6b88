Winning away in the Premier Soccer League is tough wherever you are travelling to but off-form BidVest Wits can point to a happy hunting ground on their visits to Lamontville Golden Arrows in recent times.Wits are among the favourites for the Premier Soccer League title this season but have taken just a single point from their last three games after defeats to Cape Town City and SuperSport United and a draw with Highlands Park.Next up for Gavin Hunt s side is a trip to Golden Arrows on Wednesday a team they have enjoyed fantastic success against in Durban over the last decade.Wits last eight visits to Abafana Bes thende have yielded five wins three draws and no defeats dating all the way back to 2008.Arrows last beat the Clever Boys in Durban nine years ago making this away day a favourite for the Johannesburg side.Hunt is wary of his team s slump in form though but says the results do not reflect the performances. We have let ourselves down in the last three games. It's been poor from a results perspective but football sometimes goes like that Hunt told reporters."You've got to be brave and stand up. But I will always be honest when we deserve to lose but that game against Cape Town City [2-3] not a chance not the slightest of chance."Highlands Park [2-2] was the same possibly SuperSport [0-2] certainly they didn't deserve to beat us but I mean they beat us so it's what happens."After Arrows Wits final two games of the year are home to Free State Stars and away at Maritzburg United two games they will certainly expect to win if they are to mount a serious title challenge this year.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
