Kaizer Chiefs fans once again bayed for coach Steve Komphela's blood following an uninspiring 0-0 draw at home to Bloemfontein Celtic last night.The Chiefs hierarchy will probably not take kindly to this but the truth hurts sometimes, doesn't it?The fact that Amakhosi have now gone eight matches without a win goes a long way in proving that this is a struggling side.In fact, they haven't won a game in open play in nine outings if you consider that they needed penalties to get past Maritzburg United in the Telkom Knockout about two months ago. Here we are talking of a team that is simply poor in the final third and last night was no exception.No wonder the fans vented their anger on coach Steve Komphela, for the fourth Absa Premiership match running.As early as the 14th minute, striker Michelle Katsvairo could have given Chiefs the lead but - you guessed it right - he failed to hit the target.It started with Celtic goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb making a hash of his clearance and Katsvairo getting the opportunity to score, but was nowhere near hitting the target with his attempt.Midfielder Lucky Baloyi, who had come in for the suspended Willard Katsande, then let fly minutes later but again his shot was over the bar.Nothing was going right for Chiefs who were forced to substitute the injured George Lebese. He was replaced by newly-signed Joseph Molangoane just before the interval.The second half was pretty much the same; chances were created on either side but no one took advantage.Tignyemb produced the save of the match just nine minutes into the second half when he denied Eric Mathoho, whose header could have easily ended in the back of the net.Even worse, some supporters could be seen walking out with over 20 minutes remaining. Some argued that they were actually looking for cover because it was drizzling but a few could be seen leaving the stadium.Not that they missed anything.Molangoane had a penalty shout turned down and Musa Nyatama tried a couple of times for the visitors, but Brilliant Khuzwayo was equal to the task.Predictably, the home fans chanted "Steve must go, Steve must go" in reference to the embattled coach.l Elsewhere, Golden Arrows and Bidvest Wits also played to a goalless draw at Princess Magogo Stadium. Free State Stars beat Baroka 1-0, while Polokwane City edged Chippa United by the same scoreline in Polokwane.
