Thabiso Semenya is not surprised how Polokwane City have started the season. Currently in fourth place, City are playing with no fear both at home and on the road."We prepared well during pre-season and we told ourselves we want to finish in the top eight. We know we have to collect as many points as possible."Away from home, City have lost just once in the league, and it's the same at home. Belgian coach Luc Eymael is getting the best out of his players, while experienced players such as Semenya, Jabulani Maluleke, and Thapelo Tshilo are making sure the younger players are not content with fighting relegation every season.City have scored 15 goals and they are looking good to finish as one of the league's top scorers, considering they have Thobani Mncwango, Puleng Tlolane and Rodney Ramagalela as striking options.Semenya gives four key reasons for City's good form.The impact of Eymael"He understands how to manage African players. He has worked in many African countries. He is results- driven and a hard worker."Experienced players bring winning mentality"We want to change the mentality of saying Polokwane City always fights relegation. So as senior players, we want to prove to the younger guys that we can compete with anyone."Same approach at home and away"We lost once away from home, against Cape Town City. The approach is always the same, whether we are home or away. We attack and create chances."Goals"Truly speaking, we should have scored many more goals. We have missed one-on-one chances and we missed chances in matches we drew. But we are doing well, nonetheless."
