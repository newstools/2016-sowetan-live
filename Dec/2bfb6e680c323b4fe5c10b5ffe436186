Ali "Rush Hour" Funeka cannot afford to lose to WBO Intercontinental welterweight champion Jeff Horn in Auckland, New Zealand, tomorrow.That is because a loss against a novice of only 15 wins and a draw could either signal the end of Funeka's illustrious 22-year boxing career or relegate the veteran of 39 wins, five losses and three draws to a permanent under-card fighter.Funeka currently holds the WBO Africa title which will not be on line against that organisation's Intercontinental champion tomorrow.But a loss for the 38-year-old Mdantsane warrior will see him forfeit the No 8 spot in the WBO rankings.Funeka will be stripped of his IBO International belt that he successfully defended in Russia in March if the former IBO champion fails to beat the inexperienced Horn.Horn will put his No 2 spot in the WBO ratings on line.Victory will put Horn in a favourable position to challenge the current WBO welterweight holder Manny Pacquiao.That is because Pacquaio's promoter Bob Arum does not see Pacquiao defending against No 1 contender Timothy Bradley because the two fighters have fought each other three times already.Funeka has a puncher's chance to upset Horn. He was in this similar situation in 2008 when he knocked out Zahir Raheem in round four of an IBF lightweight title eliminator.The hammer-fisted fighter boasts 31 knockouts in 39 wins. The bout tomorrow will feature in the bill where New Zealander Joseph Parker will host American Andy Ruiz Junior for a WBO heavyweight vacant belt.
