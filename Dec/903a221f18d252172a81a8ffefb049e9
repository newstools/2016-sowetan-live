Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler is under less scrutiny now compared to his time with Orlando Pirates but many will remember that he lost two finals with the Buccaneers.Tinkler has gone about his business quietly with the Mother City club, but reaching the Telkom Knockout final means he will be thrust back into the spotlight when they take on SuperSport United tomorrow at Peter Mokaba Stadium (6pm).Last year, he settled for a silver medal in the CAF Confederation Cup against Tunisian side Etoile du Sahel, while doing the same on the domestic front when Bucs were outplayed by SuperSport in the Nedbank Cup earlier this year.So, as much as Tinkler is treading carefully and claiming that SuperSport are the favourites to win the knockout, his charges will have to be at their best to help him avoid a third cup final defeat in just 14 months."The pressure is the same (as at Pirates). Remember, my boss (John Comitis) expects me to win every game and that's normal - that's what is expected at Pirates," he said."Obviously, the demand by the public is different you understand. The social media is a headache for us as coaches and you guys (the media) are always scrutinising us. Obviously, there (at Pirates) they get more scrutinised than anywhere else and that's the added pressure."Tinkler, though, will rather put his players first and hopes they can finish the job against SuperSport to fulfil their pre-season promise. "The players know the importance of this game. We spoke about all of this right at the beginning of the season. Here is an opportunity for them to create a legacy for themselves."
