Quite a few coaches will start the new week knowing that their days as head coaches in the PSL are numbered.Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is without a doubt at the top of this unfortunate list.Even though Komphela believes management are on his side during their horrible run of form, the coach surely knows that going seven matches without a win at a big club like Amakhosi is unacceptable and the big bosses will want answers for what can now be described as a crisis.Amakhosi were poor in their 3-1 defeat to Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday, their third defeat of the season.Sowetan has learnt that most of Amakhosi's management are in favour of a change of coach, but the final decision rests with chairman Kaizer Motaung, who has not quite given up on Komphela yet.It is not just results that have put pressure on Komphela, but also Chiefs' transfer business that has yet to pay dividends. Constant changes in the starting line-up have also not helped the team's, and Komphela's, cause.Komphela is not the only one living on borrowed time. At Platinum Stars, Cavin Johnson is skating on thin ice with the team in 14th place in the standings.Dikwena's situation is in stark contrast to last season, when Ndumiso Mabena and Eleazar Rodgers shone to help the team finish third and qualify for next year's CAF Confederation Cup.They are struggling at the back and their strike force is not as sharp as the teeth of the animal they are nicknamed after - a crocodile. That they have been beaten five times at home should make Johnson very uncomfortable in his chair.Even though they were brought in recently by their clubs, Gordon Igesund and Giovanni Solinas cannot relax because their club bosses have shown that they are not afraid to fire coaches. Igesund is without a league win since taking over at Highlands Park in October.Bottom of the table Highlands are conceding far too many goals, currently the worst in the league with 21 conceded. If he lasts another month, Igesund will have an opportunity to bolster his squad in the January transfer window.
