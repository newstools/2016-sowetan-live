One in three children between the ages of 15 and 19 years have experienced some form of sexual abuse a report that highlights that much needs to be done to help realise children s rights reveals.The report titled Global Goal for Every Child: Progress and disparities among South African children was launched in Johannesburg on Wednesday by the South African Human Rights Council (SAHRC) in conjunction with Unicef. Boys and girls are equally vulnerable to abuse although the types of abuse they experience tend to be different. The widespread fear of crime moreover restricts children s physical mobility and social interactions outside their homes the report says.The report also shows that many children face serious learning difficulties. Data from national assessments indicate that less than 50% of children who reach grade nine adequately master their home language while nearly all fail to meet learning standards in mathematics. The report says large disparities persist in access to and completion of schooling especially by wealth and disability status. For instance youths with disabilities are on average less than half as likely to have completed secondary schooling as their non-disabled peers. The report also notes that there are large differences in the availability of education facilities between the country s provinces.
