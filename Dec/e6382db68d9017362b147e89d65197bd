This past Saturday marked 20 years since the South African constitution was signed into law by the founding father of democratic South Africa, President Nelson Mandela.Many South Africans joined in the celebrations of one of the best constitutions in the world.The government, known for its pompous celebrations, also joined in. Unfortunately the government celebrations were led by a man who has made breaking and undermining the constitution his daily staple since he came into office in 2009.Reflecting on the year that was 2016, as South Africans we should be proud of our institutions like the auditor-general, public protector and judiciary.Even when they were attacked left and right by many politicians, especially those who are suspected of being captured by that family that lives next to a shebeen in one of the plush suburbs of Johannesburg, these institutions remained strong and forthright in their service to the people of South Africa.It is also a year that the constitutional court found President Jacob Zuma to have broken his oath of office and acted in a manner that is inconsistent with the constitution of the Republic.As I was writing this, the Western Cape High Court had just found that the employment of the SABC one-man wrecking machine, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, was invalid and irrational.We must also thank the citizens of this beautiful country for exercising their democratic right of electing local governments of their own choice. South African democracy is alive and well.Given the events of 2016, what are we likely to see in 2017 and how does the party I belong to, the DA, respond to the likely events of 2017.I call them likely events for I am not a fortune teller and I am not certain that each event will happen as I imagine it to be.[The year] 2017 will mark 10 years since the watershed Polokwane conference of the ANC that delivered to South Africa a compromised man in Zuma as president.For those who followed the run-up to [ANC's] Polokwane conference [in 2007] will remember that the line that separated the party and the state was non-existent.The ANC internal fights spiralled over to the public service and law enforcement agencies.It was hard to find public servants who were not aligned to one faction or the other of the ANC.I do not expect 2017 to be a better year than 2007.From my reading of the situation, 2017 will be worse than 2007.I have written before about the two competing factions in the ANC - Cyril Ramaphosa (CR17) vs Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma (NDZ).The CR17 group is fashioning itself as reformists and the NDZ grouping basically wants the status quo to remain.The political and media agenda will be dominated by this battle, the ANC succession race.We will be bombarded by analysis, some of which will be sponsored (captured), telling us why one particular candidate is better than the other.For us in the DA we should not be excited by the noises from the succession debate in the ANC and should not behave like spectators in a boxing match.The outcome of the ANC race has a direct impact on our plans for 2019 and beyond.It thus becomes very important for our government, especially in the Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela metros to govern very well and show the DA difference in the lives of the people.We must govern in 2017 like it is our last year of governing for we have been given a unique opportunity by the voters of South Africa.The DA needs to give hope to South Africans that a new kind of politics and politician has arrived in SA, the politics of CHANGE, an ethical politician.Our leader, Mmusi Maimane, needs to lead society and must prepare himself for the Union Buildings in 2019. Ours must remain a service to the people of this beautiful country of ours.Gana is the DA member of the Gauteng legislature.
