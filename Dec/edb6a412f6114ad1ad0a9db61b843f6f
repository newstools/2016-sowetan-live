NSRI urges the public to heed the municipal authorities decision which was made in the interests of public safety he said. Media and the public are urged to follow official notifications regarding this situation posted by municipal authorities and cooperation is deeply appreciated.

One of the surf-skis was found to be damaged from a shark bite he said adding that all three were taken aboard the NSRI s rescue craft brought to shore without incident and required no further assistance.Rodgers said that Ben Swart 55 from Pretoria told NSRI that he and his two friends Nick Bester and Ronald Pronk regular paddlers on holiday in Plettenberg Bay were paddling from Central Beach to Keurbooms on their three surf-skis about 400m off-shore well behind the back-line .When asked if he would get back in the water Swart replied: There is no doubt I will be back this is a freak incident . I ll certainly be back probably tomorrow he said adding that he was getting a replacement paddle-ski. TMG Digital
