The main black box from a Russian military plane that crashed Sunday in the Black Sea with 92 people onboard has been found, Russia s defence ministry told local news agencies Tuesday. The main black box was found at 5:42 am Moscow time (0242 GMT) 1,600 metres from the shore at a depth of 17 metres, agencies quoted the ministry as saying. Russia has grounded all Tupolev-154 planes until it understands why one of the ageing Soviet planes crashed into the Black Sea on Sunday, killing all 92 on board, the Interfax news agency cited an unnamed source as saying on Tuesday. Russian news agencies cited the Defence Ministry earlier on Tuesday as saying that authorities had found one of the downed plane s flight recorders.
