The Democratic Alliance will write to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police Fran ois Buekman to urge that he request for the finalised report from the Claassen Inquiry into the fitness to hold office of the suspended National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega to be tabled before Parliament.Reports on Sunday indicated that the final report has been ready since November 13 the party noted.DA spokesman on police matters Zakhele Mbhele pointed out that Section 8(6) of the SAPS Act stated that: At the conclusion of the inquiry the board shall submit its report to (i) the President; (ii) the Commissioner concerned; and (iii) the Parliamentary Committees. While the DA welcomes the finding that Phiyega is unfit for office as we have long and consistently argued we maintain that the terms of reference of the inquiry should have been widened to include all of Phiyega s failings during her tenure so that the premise for arriving at this accurate conclusion was a comprehensive one. The DA made submissions last year to President Zuma to this effect Mbhele stated. Phiyega presided over the persistent and chronic decline of the SAPS and compromised its ability to ensure that ordinary South Africans are safe and secure in their homes workplaces and on the streets he asserted.
