The Independent Examinations Board (IEB) declared itself proud of the achievements of the Class of 2016 after its candidates achieved a pass rate of 98.67% marginally up on last year s 98.3%. All IEB matriculants can check their exam results live at matric.sowetanlive.co.zaAnd out of those who passed all achieved a pass that is good enough to enter tertiary study at one of the three levels the board said in a statement marking the release of the results at midnight.It listed these levels:- 87.61% achieved entry to degree study (85.26% in 2015);- 9.83% qualified for entry to diploma study (11.66% in 2015); and- 1.23% achieved entry for study at the higher certificate level (1.37% in 2015). With a commitment to hard work over 12 years of schooling supported by a dedicated cohort of teachers and parents these learners have achieved the first major milestone in their learning careers said IEB CEO Anne Oberholzer. There is also a clear realisation among IEB learners their parents and their teachers that having the knowledge and understanding that lies behind the results on the certificate is far more important and meaningful for success after one s schooling. To have a certificate with good results but not the substance of learning required for success simply means facing failure at the next step of your learning career. The IEB said 11022 full-time and 703 part-time candidates wrote the IEB National Senior Certificate examinations in October and November 2016.These were conducted in 237 examination venues across the country which was up from 209 in 2015 due to 10 new schools joining the IEB as well as the fact that some institutions operate nationally with multiple examination venues to accommodate learners around the country .The IEB was also proud that the 2016 examinations were conducted without any incidents that challenge the integrity of the process or the credibility of the results .It said Umalusi otherwise known as the Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further Education and Training had monitored all aspects of the 2016 examination process and declared the results as fair and valid .The IEB statement noted that while the incidence of dishonesty across many education systems is on the increase that it has prioritised the protection of its examinations from breaches of security as far as possible using sophisticated technology and emphasising the ethical role that educators must play in building an ethical society . The IEB is conscious that any examination system is only as strong at the weakest link in the integrity chain and is fortunate to have a strong record in the absolute protection of its examination process the IEB said.Candidates can apply for re-marks until January 10 2017. Results from re-marking will be released on February 1 and the closing date to enrol for supplementary examinations is February 6. TMG Digital
