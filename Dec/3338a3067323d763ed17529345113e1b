If the unwanted gifts flooding on to the secondhand market are anything to go by South Africa badly needs to get its Christmas act together.Classifieds websites are a treasure trove of festive leftovers but many of the offerings are about as appetising as a three-day-old turkey sandwich. An advertiser from Durbanville in Cape Town s northern suburbs appears to have had a less than ideal Christmas offering a deep-fry basket from Woolworths for R200. A neighbour in the same suburb says: I have an Australian Crocodile Dundee sun hat with all the corks in place. In Umhlanga KwaZulu-Natal there is a Kenwood Chef multi-food grinder attachment on sale for R1 000 and in Sunninghill Johannesburg a Philips food processor is up for grabs at R950. If kitchen appliances are popular unwanted gifts from men to women in Germiston there may be a woman who got her own back. An advertiser there is offering an electric lawnmower for R1 250. There is likely to be a particularly disgruntled gift giver in Pretoria where a Gumtree advertiser is offering a brand new Opel Adam worth R230 000. Unwanted gift car is new. Interested buyers can make an offer says the advertiser. TMG Digital/The Times
