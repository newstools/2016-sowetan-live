The Madondo clan in KwaZulu-Natal is seeking answers as to how the land they successfully claimed and their R3.1-million restitution grant ended up in the hands of the wrong trust.In court papers before the Land Claims Court in Randburg, Johannesburg, the Madondo Land Claim Community seeks an order compelling the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights to cancel its decision to transfer their land to the Silindokuhle Community Trust.The Madondos wanted portions of land in Weenen, an area described as the second-oldest European settlement in the country, to be registered under the Madondo Community Trust.The clan accuses officials of the restitution commission of colluding with former trustees of Silindokuhle Trust to avert the transfer of the land to its rightful owners.The Silindokuhle Trust controlled some portions of land in Weenen.In a new judgment on a technical matter relating to the main application by the Madondos, Judge Thomas Ncube pointed out the clan "successfully lodged a land claim" with the commission."A monetary compensation was awarded as being equitable redress. The Silindokuhle Trust was formed. Monies paid as compensation were paid into the Silindokuhle Trust account," Ncube wrote in the ruling.In a founding affidavit of the Madondos, Mqhwagi Mncube said the R3.1-million restitution discretionary grant meant for them was paid into the banking account of the Silindokuhle Trust.Mncube included proof from Ithala bank as evidence. The money was "subjected to wanton looting by the erstwhile trustees of [Silindokuhle Trust] with the full knowledge and/or collusion with officials of the commission", Mncube said in the papers."I am fortified in believing the existence of such collusion on account that the said misuse of the funds paid over to banking account of the [Silindokuhle Trust] was never subjected to any forensic investigation even though the officials of the commission promised that such steps would be taken as far back as July 2011."It is an inescapable and undeniable reality that the officials of the [commission] deliberately clustered the various claims of communities around Weenen with the sole purpose of defrauding them of the grants allocated to them and furthermore to stifle any development aspiration that such communities might have," said Mncube.He gave the restitution commission's KwaZulu-Natal office until this past Monday to file responding papers .KwaZulu-Natal commission spokeswoman Nokuthokoza Zulu yesterday would not say what its position on the application was."I confirm that there is such a matter before the courts, but the details of which I am not at liberty to disclose until such time that the court process has been finalised."The Silindokuhle Trust could not be reached for comment.
