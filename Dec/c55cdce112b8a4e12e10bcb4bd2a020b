Cavin Johnson says he is looking forward to returning to continental football when Platinum Stars take part in the 2017 Caf Confederation Cup early next year.Stars were drawn against Uniao do Songo from Mozambique in their preliminary round when the Confederation of African Football made the draw for the opening rounds of the 2017 edition in the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Wednesday.Dikwena booked their ticket to the continents second-tier competition by finishing third in the Absa Premiership last season behind champions Mamelodi Sundowns and runners-up Bidvest Wits. That s an interesting time for us (the Confederation Cup) because I think a lot of the younger and fringe players will gain a lot of experience playing continental football said Johnson after his team earned a credible 2-2 draw away at Highlands Park on Tuesday.Johnson said his team will take the competition with the seriousness it deserves. He was the head coach in 2008 when Stars became the first South African side to beat the mighty Egyptian club Al Ahly on South African soil.Stars won a first-leg clash 2 1 at Super Stadium (now called Lucas Moripe Stadium) at the third round of the African Champions League eight years ago.The result however only provided some short-lived success as Stars lost the second leg 0 2 and were knocked out of the tournament 2-3 on aggregate I ve been there before with Mamelodi Sundowns (as assistant coach) with Platinum Stars. It s always has been a difficult ride especially when you play the North African teams. They ve been playing in these tournaments for 30 or 40 years they know how to win it they know how to go to the next step. It s always difficult. You always have to be clinical you have to be a little bit more tactically astute be better prepared especially mentally.SuperSport United who qualified for the competition as last season s Nedbank Cup winners were drawn against Madagascan club Elgeco Plus.In the continent s premier competition the African Champions League reigning champions Mamelodi Sundowns will start the defence of their title with a first-round meeting against either KCCA from Uganda or Primeiro de Agosto from Angola.Last season s league runners-up BidVest Wits open their Champions League campaign away at Reunion side AS Saint Louisianne but will have the second leg at home.
