SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter does not regret starting with Jeremy Brockie in the Telkom Knockout final against Cape Town City on Saturday.Brockie was a victim of a bad tackle on his ankle by Orlando Pirates' Thabo Matlaba in the semi final, but was rushed back in for the final and he now faces some time on the sidelines recovering after aggravating the injury.Brockie was not his usual predatory self on Saturday and made way for Cole Alexander without making an impact in the match."We don't regret it, but it may be a while before he gets back. I think going into a cup final, you would do the same thing again. He is a goalscorer," said Baxter, who lost his first cup final as a head coach in the PSL."We missed Brockie's presence in our game against Bloemfontein Celtic last weekend, so he tells us 'I feel 100 percent', but he has a ligament that's torn. We strapped it as well as we could, but the sharpness that's normally there was not there."As he walked to the SuperSport bus after the defeat, Brockie said: "I would not have played if I did not feel I could go through with it. There's plenty of rehab ahead and I will come back stronger. I guess the mid season break is coming at the right time because I can use that time to get my body back."The defeat ended SuperSport's 14-game unbeaten run. Currently second in the league, Baxter is hoping they can finish the year on a high after the weekend's defeat."The lads worked very hard and I can't criticise them. An unbeaten run has to come to an end sometimes."
