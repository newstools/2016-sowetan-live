The fifth parliament has given citizens little reason to be proud. It has not been worthy of much praise and neither has it inspired confidence in South Africans about the country's sociopolitical trajectory.But the developments of the past few days of the inquiry into the SABC board's fitness to hold office give hope that the sanctity and stature of parliament is not as yet irredeemable.It has been rare to see parliament working harmoniously and putting aside partisan interests and petty squabbles to unite behind a principle.Debates, even on matters of national interest such as the situation at institutions of higher learning, have degenerated into bickering that has not kept the South African people at the centre of parliament's actions and decision-making.In fact, the mention of parliament among ordinary people elicits expressions of disillusionment, amusement and an air of dismissiveness.Viewership of the parliamentary channel has not increased because people have been drawn by the prowess with which MPs argue for the promotion of the public interest but for the grandstanding and showmanship that both the governing party and opposition have come to be known for.This is why it is refreshing and even encouraging to see our parliamentarians working in unison to carry out the key mandate of that institution: to exercise oversight over state entities and to hold to account those who have failed to effectively execute their leadership responsibilities in these institutions.With all the shenanigans that have been going on at the public broadcaster - which can be quantified in the demonstrated arrogance of one Hlaudi Motsoeneng, obstinate defiance of the one-man board led by Mbulaheni Maguvhe, and indifference of Communications Minister Faith Muthambi - it looked as though nothing and no one could intervene to stop the self-destruction and implosion of the SABC.Motsoeneng and Maguvhe seem drunk with power. Just a week ago, they were so emboldened as to walk out on a sitting of the parliamentary inquiry, a statement that they are not subject to anyone but their own whims. Maguvhe even failed to make an appearance on the day he was scheduled to testify, compelling MPs to petition speaker Baleka Mbete to issue a summons.Maguvhe finally had to face the inquiry this week and he confirmed by his ignorance and nonchalant attitude about the disturbing goings-on at the SABC that he has not led the board but has been led by the nose by Motsoeneng, who has become some form of larger than life demi-god.Sitting before an unapologetic, unrelenting and uncompromising team of MPs, Maguvhe, in the absence of his partner in crime, capitulated and disintegrated. The MPs that he had disrespected and defied days earlier put him in his place.Their thorough questioning and superior knowledge of the legislation and regulations governing the running of the SABC left him no choice but to concede that he would comply with a parliamentary decision that he should quit the board.This should be a very encouraging development for ordinary people who are concerned by the growing disregard for the law and the strengthening inclination towards corruption in government.Although parliament is composed of different political parties who campaigned on varying ideological and policy lines, when MPs occupy the House, they are representing the people of South Africa.Ideally, party interest should be subservient to the public interest, where these contradict each other.Of course, it would be na ve to conceive that parties in parliament would completely set aside all partisan interests but the hope is that they at least strive for the ideal even though the ideal may never be perfectly approximated.Ultimately this is what parliament is about.MPs in general and leaders of caucus in particular must remain cognisant of their duty and mandate to serve the people of this country, whose will they are meant to express and embody.Parliament needs to cease being the boxing ring where partisan political interests battle it out to gain mastery over each other.It should be the arena where the differences between and within society are aired, not for the purpose of amplifying that difference. Parliament should be the platform where society can be moved from a focus on what divides us to the values and principles that unite us.As disparate as our political ideologies and interests may be, ultimately all have a common interest. And that common interest is (should be), to build a just, equitable society where there is solidarity among all people, no matter who they are or where they come from.The conduct of inquiry into the SABC board tells us that there is yet hope to achieve this ideal.Comment on Twitter @NompumeleloRunj
