Angry shouts of "sies" and "you must rot in jail" reverberated briefly inside a packed court room at the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.The anger was directed at a 36-year-old man when he appeared in the court for the kidnapping and keeping 12-year-old girl as a sex slave for two months at his Sunnyside flat in Pretoria.The child is from Mamelodi.The women, some from the girl's hometown, could not restrain themselves from hurling xenophobic bile at the accused, a Nigerian national."Satan, go back to Nigeria" and "you must go back to your country," they yelled.Many of the women came out in the colours of the ANC Women's League, the DA Women's Network and two civil groups, Sisonke and Mamelodi Women in Deeds. Magistrate Lesetja Mphahlele, as he battled to keep order, threatened to throw everyone out."Either you behave yourselves or you leave the courtroom," Mphahlele told the irate women.The accused cannot be named until he has pleaded to the charges.Mphahlele postponed the proceedings to Monday on request of the state.The man, who was arrested two weeks ago, is facing counts of rape, kidnapping and human trafficking.Prosecutor Michael Shivuri said they still needed to confirm the man's fixed address."... This person [is] sharing [a place] with another person. He doesn't have a fixed address," Shivuri said.He added, however, that the accused was legal in the country, and had no criminal record.Captain Daniel Mavimbela of Sunnyside police said the Grade 7 pupil was reported missing in September.She apparently left home to meet up with friends at a recreational park in Silverton, eastern suburb of Pretoria. While there she apparently met an unknown girl who allegedly led her to the man's flat.The unknown girl spent a night with her at the flat but was nowhere to be seen the next morning.Mavimbela said the accused then allegedly kept her as a sex slave and attempted to introduce her into prostitution.A passer-by saw her trying to escape from the flat, according to police. The accused subsequently released her and he was later arrested.The women groups at the court vowed to apply to join the matter as friends of the court and oppose bail.nkosib@sowetan.co.za
