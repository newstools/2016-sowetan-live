Steve Komphela remained defiant about his tenure at Kaizer Chiefs after Saturday s loss in Port Elizabeth suggesting he was determined to fight on as coach even though speculation over his future heightened after 3-1 defeat by Chippa United. I have never given up in my life, was the answer of the 49-year-old Chiefs coach to a question on whether he believed he was still the man to lead the club after an eighth successive match a victory. I have to stay calm and take the punches, that is a job of the coach. Who else must be punched? I must stand and be strong. I will only wavere the minute I feel the pressure that should be on me is now getting to my players, he said after the Premier League defeat at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Komphela said Chiefs had defended badly and given too much space behind their left-back. It was always going to be a tough ask because Chippa play good football. We had a good first half and we had a chance to make it 2-0, the coach said. No matter how good you play, if you don t defend it can prove costly. It is not a good feeling at the moment but we can t be thinking about losing. We have to deal with the situation moving forward. Komphela did not want to be seen to be making excuses, even though he pointed out a lengthy injury list at the club, with 11 players sidelined.That will be increased in their next match against Bloemfontein Celtic on December 14 with skipper Willard Katsande suspended after picking up a fourth caution of the season. Katsande out must be seen as an opportunity for someone elsewhere to take up the position and show what they can do, Komphela said.
