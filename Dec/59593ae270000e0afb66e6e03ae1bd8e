Blitzbok coach Neil Powell has unsurprisingly retained the same experienced 12-man squad for the Cape Town leg of the HSBC World Sevens Series which kicks off in the Mother City on Saturday.After winning the 2016/17 Series opening tournament in Dubai last week Powell was never likely to change to the team willingly. Fortunately minor niggles to captain Philip Snyman and Kwagga Smith were not serious and the pair were cleared for duty on home soil this weekend. The Blitzboks were completely dominant in Dubai winning all six of their matches which included a superb 40-0 win over New Zealand in the quarterfinals and a 26-14 win over Olympic gold medallists Fiji in the final. The squad that will attempt to defend its Cape Town title as well as claim its fourth consecutive SA leg title after winning in Port Elizabeth in 2013 and 2014 has a combined 375 tournament caps.That makes the Blitzboks easily the most experienced of the 16 teams in the tournament. We are fortunate to be able to again field an experienced squad Powell said. There were niggles from Dubai but those were expected as the guys have not played for a couple of months.Luckily for us we came back from Dubai without any serious injuries and lots of belief in our systems. Powell introduced some special measures this week to try and re-focus the team's goals and mindset. "We had to start from scratch again."The players are experienced enough to be able to do that themselves so I hope the triggers we provided will be successful said Powell. South Africa will face Russia USA and Australia in Pool A on a tough opening day. We need to be sharp on Saturday as it is a dangerous pool with all three teams capable of beating a more favourite team Powell said. The fact that we play at home will lift the players no doubt but we cannot just rock up and expect the crowd to motivate us and win the games for us with their support."We need to deliver and get them in the game. Springbok Sevens captain Philip Snyman admitted that expectations at home are always huge. We realise our fans are looking at us to deliver the goods and we want nothing else said Snyman. We only have this great opportunity to play at home once every year and are determined to give it our best shot. We will not leave anything out there. The Springbok Sevens team is: 1.
