In this regard we all need to play our part in building a non-racial society he said.However it also had to be acknowledged that a lot of progress had been made in promoting unity in our country. We will not allow a few racists to win the day and take us backwards the president warned.He added that further work was being done to promote a society free of all forms of discrimination. Government is leading the process through finalising the National Action Plan to Combat Racism Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance for implementation working with key stakeholders Zuma stated. With regards to promoting gender equality we are pleased that the Constitution has enabled us to advance more women in our society with 42.5 per cent of women having been elected into legislative bodies in 2014. Work must continue steadily to achieve 50 percent in recognition of the role women play in society and our own Constitution which enshrines non-sexism.

In this regard we urge all of you to continue to be vigilant and promote safer homes communities and workplaces for women every day of the year. Women have a right to safety and security Zuma added.
