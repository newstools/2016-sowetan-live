Mamelodi Sundowns are expecting a tougher match from Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors at the Fifa Club World Cup (CWC) in today's fifth-place playoff (9.30am) than what they experienced against Kashima Antlers in the quarterfinals.Sundowns lost 2-0 on their debut at the CWC against Japan's host club Antlers, and have the fifth-place playoff against South Korea's Asian champions Jeonbuk left to play for.Sundowns winger Keagan Dolly warned the Asian champions could be tougher prospects to face than J-League champions Antlers, who Sundowns missed half-a-dozen chances against in the first half, but were outplayed in the second."It's going to be tough. We know Jeonbuk are a good team and they've got good individuals. But for us it's to convert the chances that we create," Dolly said. "We expect a similar play to Kashima. We know the Asians are good tactically. I think Jeonbuk will be a tougher team."The Downs forward, one of four Sundowns players nominated for CAF's local-based African player of 2016 award, will have to lift himself from a tired-looking performance against Antlers for one last big match for his club after a gruelling 15 months."It's been very busy - it's been a long year for Sundowns. I think it's been 15 months of non-stop football without a rest," Dolly admitted. "For some of us it's not just Sundowns, it's also the national teams. But I think throughout the campaign it's been a really good year for us."But then I think the reason why the individuals got nominated for awards was because the team did well."Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has pointed to his side's inexperience as tournament rookies and said they are in Japan on a learning curve."Me, I like it. I like this level, this stress. In fact, from these games I wish I could go direct to playing in the African Champions League. Then I would have sharpened the saw," he said.l Strydom is in Japan as a guest of Sundowns
