Wits University council, the highest decision-making body, will today approve a policy prohibiting staff from having sexual and romantic relationships with students.This was revealed by vice-chancellor Professor Adam Habib yesterday at the Commission for Gender Equality in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, where the commission held hearings on gender transformation in institutions of higher learning.Habib said the new policy, developed by the university's gender equity office, came after four lecturers in 2013 were found to be having sexual relations with students and were later fired. "This created a bit of controversy because effectively these young men and women are adults, and they have the rights of all adults," he said."However, what is also very clear in these relationships is the issue of power and how power is manipulated to effectively get sexual favours and so we were very mindful of that and, so effectively, we created a new policy."Habib said he received complaints relating to cases of young students who had fallen in love with lecturers and who had eventually married."They said 'how dare you pass this', but overall I think there was broad recognition that this is not allowed," said Habib.He said the policy has gone through all structures of the university and will go to council for approval today."There are exit clauses. We allow for exit clauses, for instance if there is a real serious case where somebody is in a long-term relationship they can report to the university's gender office and if we find that there is a sense that power and other things are not manipulative we will make an exception, but as a general rule it's not going to be allowed," he said.Meanwhile, the commission also found that at Wits males dominate on all levels of employment and they make up 75% of top and senior management, with only 29% female academics and 43% women at senior administration staff.It further found that there was a poor representation of female staff and that statistics are even worse when it comes to coloured and Indians.Habib acknowledged that the university faced a challenge concerning women empowerment, especially in senior academic levels, but said it has set itself targets to change this by 2020.The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), which was expected to make submissions to the commission yesterday, did not do so after the vice-chancellor, Dr Albert van Jaarsveld failed to pitch and instead sent a delegate.This angered commissioners. The commission decided Van Jaarsveld would be offered an opportunity early next year to make submissions.However, an analysis by the commission on the gender agenda of UKZN also found that the university had a poor representation of women employees in top management.
