City of Tshwane executive mayor Solly Msimanga is clamping down on tenders which are given out irregularly. The Tender Bid Adjudication Meeting is the crucial stage at which a tender is assessed and adjudicated on its merits and it is the stage where corruption can take place behind closed doors as cronies can be handed contracts contrary to the best interests of the public he said on Monday morning. To counter such acts of corruption we have resolved to open bid adjudication to the public. Every tender bidder will now have a fair and transparent chance at government contracts in Tshwane cutting out corruption. Msimanga was speaking at the Centurion municipal offices where he was giving feedback on his 100 days in office.In September the mayor said that the City of Tshwane will be investigating suspicious tenders worth nearly R4-billion granted by the previous administration. This came soon after the Democratic Alliance took over the running of the city with the help of coalition partners from the African National Congress administration after the August local government elections.Msimanga had said at the time that he would subject several contracts to thorough audits to establish if any criminality led to them being awarded.To date 15 city officials who have been implicated have been suspended while three were dismissed Msimanga said adding that investigations are continuing.Msimanga opened criminal cases against three senior officials who d been implicated in forensic audit investigations which had been abandoned by the previous administration.
