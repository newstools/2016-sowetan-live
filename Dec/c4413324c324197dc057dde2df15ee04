After a failed bid for Cosafa presidency five years ago, Danny Jordaan, pictured, somehow exudes confidence heading to the elective conference of the regional football governing body on Saturday.The Safa president believes SA national teams' dominance in the Southern African region rankings should stand the country in good stead going to the polls at Sun City in the North West."I take it is a discussion that we'll have in the region. They [Cosafa membership] see that SA has made tremendous progress. All our teams - men and women - are number one in our region. They think SA can make a contribution," Jordaan told Sowetan on the sidelines of the Sasol National League Championship final in Mossel Bay on Sunday.He will vie for the top seat on Saturday with incumbent Suketu Patel of the Seychelles and Zimbabwe FA president Phillip Chiyangwa. Chiyangwa has also been nominated for the vice-presidency post with Advocate Salemane Phafane of Lesotho and Frans Mbidi of Namibia FA.However, Jordaan - who is also jostling for a seat in the executive committee - seems to be prepared for any eventuality this time around, especially after the 2011 events in Botswana when he withdrew his candidature sensing imminent defeat.Cosafa is made up of a seven-member executive. All 14 Cosafa member federations will each cast a vote to determine the office bearers for the next five years.NominationsPresidency: Danny Jordaan, Suketu Patel and Phillip ChiyangwaVice-Presidency: Chiyangwa, Salemane Phafane (Lesotho), and Frans Mbidi (Namibia)Executive Committee: Jordaan, Chiyangwa, General Pedro Neto (Angola), Mclean Letshwidi, David Fani (both Botswana), Walter Nyamilandu-Manda (Malawi), Sameer Sobha (Mauritius), Alberto Simanga (Mozambique), and John Muinjo (Namibia), Timothy Shongwe (Swaziland), and Andrew Kamanga (Zambia).
