They operate under the guise of internet cafes said advocate Themba Ngobese chief executive of the Casino Association of South Africa (CASA). Ngobese was briefing the media on the contributions the casino industry made to the national economy at Montecasino on Wednesday. Online gambling in South Africa is illegal and Ngobese said: We ve been asking the government to shut them down. The government can shut them down. We ve even offered to assist the SAPS to shut them down. CASA represents 36 of South Africa s 38 licensed casinos with its members contributing R16.4-billion in value in the past year. CASA members are committed to providing employment that uplifts the communities in which the casinos operate Ngobese said. According to the 11th survey of the casino industry it contributes more than R70-million towards education.
