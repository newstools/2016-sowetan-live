The message SuperSport United are sending out to rivals are getting louder by the week.Having beaten Orlando Pirates twice as well as Mamelodi Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout, Matsatsantsa a Pitori became the first team in the Absa Premiership this season to beat title favourites Bidvest Wits.The 2-0 victory at Mbombela Stadium on Tuesday, where SuperSport are unbeaten this term, put them within a point of log leaders Cape Town City. It looks like there's very few who will be able to stop Stuart Baxter's free-scoring and organised side.Before yesterday's round of Premiership matches, Matsatsantsa were the top scoring club in the league with 18 goals and only Sundowns - who are playing catch up - had conceded less goals.Clayton Daniels and the in-form Thabo Mnyamane bagged the goals Against Wits to extend the club's unbeaten run to 13 matches."I was really disappointed with our first 20 to 25 minutes. We gave away the ball far too easily," said Baxter. "Our defensive shape was OK, so it did not lead to too many chances [for the opposition]. We made a couple of changes and the performance in the second half was better."With his defence deppleted, Wits coach Gavin Hunt gave Siboniso Gaxa his debut at right back. Bongani Khumalo also got a rare start."All our defensive players are not available. To be fair, we should have been two or three nil up before they scored," said Hunt.
