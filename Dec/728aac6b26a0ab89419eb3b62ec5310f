THROUGHOUT the year we have been discussing investment opportunities for you, our readers.We are very happy you have shared your views with us, and indeed asked us lots of important questions in your journey to achieving a financially secure future.We have chosen the last article of the year to outline what you need to be doing to get a sense of whether your investments are working for you or not?As you review your investments, which should be done once a year minimum, these are the other important considerations to make:How have my investments performed relative to my goals?It is very important to understand that most people invest with a goal in mind. If not, they really should.Investing with a goal in mind reminds you of your target and makes it easy to decide if you are moving in the right direction or not. If you are not, then it allows you room to seek advice on how else you can structure your investments to move closer to your goals.Can I still tolerate the same risk levels as last year?As we grow older, or as our investments deplete, for those invested in low growth funds, we need to answer this question carefully.A higher level of risk will deem one financially distressed, and therefore we must address it as a matter of priority.How have my financial circumstances changed over the year?It is important to realise that in life, so many decisions that we make have a direct impact on our finances.Buying a new house, having a baby, getting married, losing a partner or a bread winner, or starting a business can have big a big impact on one's finances. So, as you plan your investments for next year, do consider any changes in your circumstances, and decide if you should increase your investment allocations, or re-prioritise and adjust some of the costs you have.Are my costs of investing fair?Most of us ignore this element of our investments. We discussed this in one of our articles, and advised that readers should demand lower costs of investing. Why pay 3.42% to invest your retirement when you could negotiate it to 1% of upfront fees for example?lE-mail us on invest@iwgsa.co.za, or www.iwgsa.co.za
