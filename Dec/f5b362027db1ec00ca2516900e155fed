Star batsman AB de Villiers confirmed last night he has stepped down as captain of the SA test team with immediate effect as he recovers from an elbow injury.De Villiers, 32, was appointed in January following Hashim Amla's resignation and led the team in two Test matches against England before injury forced him to miss the series against New Zealand and Australia.SA lost one Test and won one under De Villiers. In his absence Faf du Plessis impressed with his leadership as stand-in skipper during back-to-back Test wins over Australia."The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me," said De Villiers, who backed Du Plessis."It was a fantastic honour for me to be asked to captain the Test side but I have missed two series and I am still in doubt for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka."Following the squad's outstanding performances in Australia, it is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as Test captain."I have known Faf for almost 20 years and he will have my support," he said.De Villiers has been ruled out of the three-match Test series against Sri Lanka after failing to recover sufficiently from his elbow injury. - AFP
