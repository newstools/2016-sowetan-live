A dream does not become a reality through magic but it takes sacrifice, determination and sweat, warns boxing manager Mlandeli Tengimfene.His charge Zolani "Last Born" Tete will not enjoy the Christmas festivity due to the big opportunity to fight for a world title early next year.Tete, trainers Loyiso Mtya and Zolile Tete (the boxer's father) will be hard at work in the gym to get "Last Born" in shape for the WBO bantamweight championship fight against holder Marlon Tapales from the Philippines.Tengimfene said the fight would happen on January 28 or February 4."That is why all of us at All Winners Boxing Gym will have a 'black Christmas'," said Tengimfene.Tete added: "Without sacrifices and hard work nothing grows but weeds."The boxer was supposed to have met Arthur Villanueva in an official WBO title eliminator last week. Villanueva asked for an extension because he claimed not to have had enough time to prepare.Tengimfene said the purse money was good."But we felt it was not worth risking the big chance of fighting for the actual WBO belt because we fancy our chances of winning against Villanueva. So we were prepared to wait for Villanueva to be ready. Such big opportunities come once in a lifetime and you've got to grab it with both hands," said Tengimfene.
