Head coach Gordon Igesund says he has no magic wand to turn Highlands Park players into great but remains confident of getting the team off the basement sooner rather than later.Things are not looking good for Highlands at the moment. They are bottom of the standings after 11 matches and they have won just one league match all season.Igesund, who is in his second month with the club, insisted after the 2-2 draw against Orlando Pirates at the weekend that the team is improving despite the fact that they are not getting the desired results. The overall stats at the end of 90 minutes we had 11 shots at goal and they (Pirates) had nine. We had four on target and they had five on target, so I think it was a fair result at the end of the day, Igesund stated.This was certainly a big improvement from their 5-0 loss to Mamelodi Sundowns late last month and the 60-year-old mentor cannot wait for the January transfer window to bolster the side. What is important for us as a club is to try to pass this stage up until Christmas and get to the (transfer) window. Like every other team, I need to strengthen my team and this is not to get rid of the players that got this team promoted, but to strengthen, said the four-time PSL champion.Highlands Park have four matches to play between Wednesday and December 20, which will be against Bloemfontein Celtic (Home), Ajax Cape Town (Home), Chippa United (Away) and Platinum Stars (Home).Igesund said it is vitally important to collect the points and get off the basement before the break. It is a tough battle that we got and there is no doubt about that. I haven t got a magic wand to say, right, everybody is going to be a great player now . Sometimes the players are what they are and I have to strengthen the team in certain areas, he added.After their last match against Stars on December 20, the team will go on a break and assemble for a mini pre-season camp that will start on January 9 in Cape Town.Igesund said the camp in the Mother City will last for close to two weeks.
