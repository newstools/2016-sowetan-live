Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela says the pressure he s been under in the past few months has made him stronger and built his character.Komphela had an often tempestuous relationship with the club's supporters for the better part of the year and there were times when things got so heated that police and security personnel had a closer relationship with him than even his own shadow.The Chiefs coach said the pressure from supporters and the media especially during the times when the club couldn't buy a victory made him stronger rather than broke him. We appreciate the pressure you put because part of the pressure you put on us does not only build our character but it also reveals our character " he said. Maybe the definition of who we are as we walk is through the challenges and the questions you (media and fans) throw at us. So on the back of that we thank you for making us better men better coaches and better people."Komphela wished the Chiefs fans a Merry Christmas and said he did not take any of the criticism he got this year personally. We wish you a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. Spend time with family and I hope everything that happened whatever differences were there from a personal and professional level with whoever will come to an end. And as we move into 2017 we enter as new people with new ideas and fresh energy. Wishing you the very best. TMG Digital
