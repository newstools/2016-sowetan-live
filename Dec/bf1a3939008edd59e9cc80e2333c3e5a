AB de Villiers has relinquished the captaincy of South Africa s test team with immediate effect Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Monday.He has also been ruled out of the test series against Sri Lanka which starts on December 26 because of his troublesome elbow. The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual including me De Villiers was quoted as saying in a CSA statement. Following the squad s outstanding performances in Australia it is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as the permanent test captain. I have known Faf for almost 20 years ever since we played in the same school side at Afrikaans Hoer Seunskool and he will have my unequivocal support if he is asked to continue leading this exciting Proteas test team. South African team manager Mohammed Moosajee who is also the team s doctor explained why De Villiers elbow which was surgically repaired early in October was still not up to scratch: AB s left elbow is much improved but is still regaining the last few degrees of straightening. Fitness to play requires full range of elbow movement and this may take another three to four weeks to achieve. He will be unavailable for the test series against Sri Lanka and will target a return for the one-day series starting at the end of January. CSA confirmed that Faf du Plessis who has led South Africa to victory in nine of the 11 matches they have played since De Villiers has been on the sidelines would continue as captain for the Lankan test series.But Du Plessis could be suspended if he loses his appeal which will be heard on December 19 against a ball-tampering conviction. - TMG Digital
