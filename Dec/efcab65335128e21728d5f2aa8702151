A family has been waiting five months for answers from the police.The Coligny, North West, family opened a case of murder when their 18-year-old daughter Keitumetse Robinson was run over, allegedly by a farmer, on July 29.The charge was changed by the police to culpable homicide. The family claim the investigating officer has not given them information regarding the case.Keitumetse's mother, Mahube Robinson, said all she wanted was for the farmer to at least appear in court or for the police to tell her what had happened to the case.According to the family, the farmer was not arrested or taken in for questioning.Robinson said her daughter's soul was not going to rest in peace until they knew what exactly happened to her. Keitumetse and her friend had been looking for employment in the farms in the area when she was killed.Robinson claimed a woman who had accompanied her daughter that day said the farmer, who is known to the family, chased after them and drove over Keitumetse.After the incident, the farmer is alleged to have placed an empty beer can in Keitumetse's hand.Yesterday, provincial police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said investigators needed to take more statements before they could take the case to the prosecuting authorities for a decision."We expect to complete the case soon and take the case to court for decision, for now it is still under investigation," Mokgwabone said.He said police registered the case as culpable homicide because they cannot prove it was murder."The court will be able to decide whether this case can be changed to murder, for now it is registered as culpable homicide," he said.Independent Police Investigative Directorate national spokesman Moses Dlamini said the family must take up their concern with the station commander if they feel the police are dragging their feet."The family must first seek intervention from the station commander and then come to us if they feel that they are not getting help," he said.Dlamini said cases like these must be treated with a sense of urgency and the family must be updated by the police at all times.tshehleb@sowetan.co.za
