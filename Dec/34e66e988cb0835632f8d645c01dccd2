Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure admitted yesterday to being over the legal limit following a drink-driving conviction, but had no explanation for saying he does not consume alcohol because of his religious beliefs.Toure was arrested in London on November 28 and was given an 18-month ban and a fine of R936000 in court on Monday. The 33-year-old Ivorian issued a statement on his website saying he had not intentionally drunk alcohol but shed no light on how he gave an illegal reading."I have always refused alcohol. Anyone who knows me or follows football will have seen me refuse champagne for Man of the Match performances because of my commitment to my religion," Toure said, adding he decided not to challenge the charge because he was above the limit.Toure has had a troubled year at City after a fallout with coach Pep Guardiola left him on the sidelines for three months.He returned to the first team on November 19, scoring both goals in a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace, and played in a 2-1 victory at Burnley two days before his arrest. - Reuters
