Kaizer Chiefs have pleaded with the ailing club s increasingly irate supporters to remain calm as the pressure continues to mount on beleaguered coach Steve Komphela.Incensed Chiefs fans have demonstrated their frustration with Komphela by continuing to hurl missiles and direct abuse at the embattled coach after the club s recent matches.He has had to be escorted out of venues by police and security officials with an assortment of objects raining down from the stands.Chiefs spokesman Vina Maphosa admitted that the club is going through a rough patch but pleaded for calm. These are difficult times and we are also disappointed by the poor run of results Maphosa said. With regards to the behaviour of a section of the supporters it is not what we want to see at our games. We know that our supporters are used to winning and winning is one of the founding principles at Kaizer Chiefs. But we appeal to those who are engaging on these acts to calm down. We understand their pain. We are down but we are not out. Chiefs are seventh on the PSL standings and they have played 12 won four drawn five and lost three matches.They have not won a game since beating Ajax Cape Town 2-0 in October.That rare victory was followed by goalless draws against Orlando Pirates and Baroka FC a 1-2 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns 1-1 draws with SuperSport United and Cape Town City and Saturday s 1-3 loss to Chippa United.The defeat to United in particular was seemingly a bitter pill to swallow for some of the supporters and they went as far as damaging the canopy over the entrance to the tunnel at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.While speculation continues to mount over Komphela s future he must be grateful that Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung is a patient man and prefers to give his coaches a chance before finally pulling the trigger.But even Motaung s patience will soon run out if Komphela is unable to halt the slide in the club s remaining matches of the year.Chiefs remaining home matches are against Bloemfontein Celtic (December 14) Polokwane City (December 18) and away to Golden Arrows on December 21.
