The number of strikes in South Africa are increasing and a majority are now not compliant with the Labour Relations Act highlighting a challenge for government departments mediator forums trade unions and employers.In 2015 the Department of Labour notes 55% of the total strikes were unprotected strikes meaning they were not complying with the LRA as compared to 48% observed in 2014.The department s latest annual update report on strike activities in the South African labour market assesses how all key indicators perform in line with various shocks in the South African economy over a 10-year period.The number of strikes working days lost and number of workers involved in strike in South Africa fluctuated in the past ten years from 2005 to 2015 with an annual average of 85 strike incidents 5.2 million working days lost and 335 000 workers involved per annum respectively the report states.There was a fluctuation on working days lost in the past ten year s period. However the lowest number of working days lost were recorded in 2008 with 497 436 days lost. Over the 2015 period the number of working days lost were 903 921.The wages lost decreased dramatically from R6.1 billion in 2014 to R116 million in 2015. This represents a decrease of 98% in wages lost in the economy. Over the 10-year analysis period it represents 62% in wages lost. The department said the variation in wages lost could be attributed to the number of workers who participated in strikes and the duration of strikes for a particular period.The mining industry has shown relatively higher working days lost as compared to other industries from 2013-2015 but a trend in strikes occurrence has also been recorded in the manufacturing and transport industries.The lowest number of strikes was seen in the Finance and Utilities industries between 2013-2015.By province Gauteng experienced a higher number of work stoppages as compared to other provinces from 2013-2015. This could be associated with the size of its provincial economy compared to the size of other provincial economies the department said.Disputes over wages bonuses and other compensation matters remain the main cause of strikes in the country.The analysis shows that in most cases wage settlements were lower than the initial wage demands by unions. On the other hand in more than 50% of the cases wage increases are imposed on workers where collective bargaining did not result in an agreement on wages.More than 61% of work stoppages lasted between 1-5 days in 2013 and 2015; and between 16-20 days in 2014.
