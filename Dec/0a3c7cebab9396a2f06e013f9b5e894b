If anyone had told Eric Tinkler that Cape Town City would be Telkom Knockout champions just four months into the season, he would not have believed it.It's not that he does not believe in himself as a coach capable of winning trophies, but his mission was to ensure the team does well enough to survive at the end of the season.Now City are dropping jaws at top of the table and they are Telkom Knockout champions, after a 2-1 victory over SuperSport United at Peter Mokaba Stadium in the final on Saturday - Tinkler's first cup triumph as head coach.What Tinkler has achieved in such a short space of time with City, who scored 12 goals in four knockout matches, is incredible."Proud moment for me, proud moment for the boys. I don't think it was a great performance, but we did enough to win the game and deservedly so," said Tinkler, after goals from Aubrey Ngoma and substitute Judas Moseamedi sealed the memorable victory."Truth be told, I did not think we would be where we are now. Cups were definitely not on my mind. The league has always been my priority, particularly because this was a new club. Yes we kept 14 players of the Aces team, but only five were regulars. We had to rebuild the whole defence."The City players, according to Tinkler, will be smiling all the way to the bank during the festive season with bonuses from the cup competition as well as their good league position."There's also a monetary reward. Christmas is around the corner and our league form is good, so they will be getting a bonus."
