While noting that it is considered impolite to speak ill of the dead the Democratic Alliance s James Selfe said that in the case of the death of Ananias Mathe society is now free from a dangerous and malevolent individual . The death in prison of the notorious criminal and escape artist Ananias Mathe brings to an end a chapter for our prison system. Mr Mathe was a serial rapist robber and murderer and was serving a life sentence in the Kokstad C Max prison Selfe the party s correctional services spokesman said on Wednesday morning.On Tuesday TMGDigital spoke to a senior prisons official in KwaZulu-Natal who said the convicted rapist murderer and house robber was suffering complications from an apparent digestive issue over the past three months.At between 4.30pm and 5pm on Tuesday the Mozambican national died in the King Edward VIII Hospital.He was reportedly suffering from severe constipation and could not urinate.The DA s Selfe said: Mr Mathe will be best remembered for his many escapes from prisons including an escape from the Pretoria C Max prison. He was supposed to have used Vaseline to push himself through a small window and then to have used a rope made of sheets and blankets to scale down one wall and up another. On another occasion while awaiting trial he was discovered with a dangerous weapon. But rather than pointing to Mathe s ingenuity or Houdini-like abilities Selfe said that these incidents show the depressing reality that offenders with large amounts of money made from the proceeds of crimes can bribe their way out of most situations . It is a tribute to the Kokstad C Max staff and the prison s security measures that he was unable to escape from that prison he added. TMG Digital
