The Constitutional Court on Wednesday upheld an appeal by French nuclear specialist Areva that a R5-billion tender it was awarded by Eskom to replace steam generators at Koeberg should stand.However the majority of the Constitutional Court did not deal with the merits of the matter.It only dealt with the preliminary point argued by Areva throughout the litigation: that the party which wanted to review Eskom s decision Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme did not have legal standing in the matter. Areva had maintained throughout that Westinghouse USA should have been the party bringing litigation.The case concerned a tender awarded by Eskom to replace six steam generators at Eskom s Koeberg nuclear power station.Since 2010 Eskom has been aware of the need to replace the steam generators. By the end of 2016 one of the units would have been in operation for 32 years.The bid tender committee of Eskom decided to invite Areva and Westinghouse to conduct parallel negotiations after various preliminary processes had been engaged in.On July 11 2014 in its final offer Westinghouse wrote to Eskom stating that: Westinghouse Electric Belgium on behalf of Westinghouse Electric Company is pleased to submit the present offer to Eskom .In August 2014 the bid tender committee of Eskom awarded the contract to Areva.Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme brought an urgent review decision before the High Court in Pretoria to set aside the award of the tender.Areva raised a preliminary point that Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme did not have standing to bring the review application.Although the high court dismissed Areva s preliminary point it still dismissed Westinghouses s application with costs.The high court found that notwithstanding the fact that Westinghouse s price was cheaper than Areva s Eskom was entitled to award the contract to Areva.Westinghouse appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) which found that the bid tender committee s decision was unlawful. It set aside the award but remitted the matter to Eskom for reconsideration.On the issue that Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme was not the correct party before court the SCA said Eskom understood that Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme was always the bidder. If the tender had been awarded to it the award would have been not to Westinghouse USA but to it the company that had in fact submitted the bid. And it was Westinghouse that had participated in the negotiations the SCA said in its judgment passed in December last year.Areva went to the Constitutional Court and still maintained that Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme did not have standing.The majority judgment of the court penned by Justice Ray Zondo agreed with Areva s contention that Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme did not have standing.Zondo said Westinghouse USA was the real bidder and Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme acted as an agent.Zondo was quick to add that the majority judgment of the court did not decide on the merits of the case because the challenge was brought by the wrong partyA minority judgment written by then Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke in which acting Justice Lebotsang Bosielo concurred said Westinghouse Electric Belgium Soci t Anonyme had a direct and substantial interest in the review application and had standing.However Moseneke said Eskom was meticulous and proper in assessments of the bids.
