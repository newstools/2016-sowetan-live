Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was 'puzzled' by the firing of the then Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene.Nene was abruptly fired by President Jacob Zuma on December 5 2015 and replaced with an ANC backbencher Des van Rooyen who was also removed only four days in office following public outcry as well as negative reaction on the economy.Van Rooyen was subsequently replaced by Pravin Gordhan.Speaking on Power FM on Wednesday night, Ramaphosa said that he was not happy with Nene's removal and how it was handled."The way it was done, could've been handled a lot better. And what has ensued thereafter," he said.Asked on allegations that he was fuming and threatened to quit following the news of Nene's removal from office, Ramaphosa laughed and said: "a number of people in government reacted in a variety of ways"."But that was a real dark moment in the history of our democracy."The firing of Nene is said to have 'robbed' the country's economy of a whooping R500million.
