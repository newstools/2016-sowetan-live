Maritzburg United have confirmed their interest in hiring Roger de Sa as head coach, but the latter cannot commit just yet because he is also apparently eyeing the Bafana Bafana job.The KwaZulu-Natal outfit is in search of a new mentor after parting ways with Ernst Middendorp last month. Fadlu Davids has since taken over in an interim role.In trying to fill the position, United chairman Farook Kadodia had an interview with De Sa recently. Kadodia revealed that de Sa would not commit until there is clarity on the national team job, which could become vacant should Shakes Mashaba be fired following his on-going disciplinary hearing. "The coach will only be finalised in January," Kadodia told Sowetan yesterday.De Sa couldn't be reached for comment, but Kadodia confirmed that the national team is in the picture as far as de Sa is concerned."The thing is that we have problems, because coaches are on the short-list for Bafana and they can't commit until the year end. So we can't talk about the coaches until the first week of January. Yes, we had an interview with Roger and that's where we finished off. He has to decide whether he works with Bafana or Maritzburg."Maritzburg, who play Pirates tonight (7.30pm) at Harry Gwala Stadium, can afford to wait because caretaker coach Davids has done well since taking over from German Middendorp.In four games under the former striker, they have won two, drawn one and lost one to move to ninth spot in the Absa Premiership standings. However, Maritzburg are still searching for their first win at home.Pirates, who also have a caretaker coach in Augusto Palacios, are struggling for consistency having drawn their last two league outings against Baroka and Highlands Park.Pirates and Maritzburg have met in 20 League matches since 2005, with the Buccaneers winning 10 games compared to five for the Team of Choice, while five matches were drawn.
