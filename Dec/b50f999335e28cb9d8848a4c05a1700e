Suspended Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba came face to face with his accusers yesterday as his disciplinary hearing officially started at Safa House.Accompanied by his legal team, Mashaba answered to allegations that he disrespected the Safa leadership during last month's World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Polokwane.Three witnesses, understood to be from Safa's media department, took to the stand yesterday as they gave evidence and were cross-examined by Mashaba's legal team and the coach himself.But the hearing adjourned after eight hours, with one of Safa's witnesses said to have testified for over four hours.It will resume this morning, but insiders said it was not expected to conclude until tomorrow, with more witnesses lined up."I don't see this hearing concluding [today] because the process of cross-examination takes long. At most we should finish on Wednesday and get a verdict by Friday or early next week," a Safa source not mandated to speak on the issue as it's an internal matter told Sowetan.Mashaba offered to resign on condition that he gets a payout, according to City Press, but this was rejected as Safa pressed ahead with the DC hearing.He faces dismissal without any compensation if found guilty of misconduct and insubordination.
