Newly-crowned WBC Youth featherweight champion Azinga "Golden Boy" Fuzile, who demolished Giorgi Gochisvili from Georgia in one round at the Mdantsane Indoor Centre last Friday, has been told to give education and not boxing, his fullest attention."I do not compromise when it comes to education. My two kids are both school goers," said trainer Mzamo "Chief" Njekanye who made sure - including digging deep into his own pockets - that Xolisani "Nomeva" Ndongeni completed his matric."I am doing the same with Azinga. As much as I am excited to see him win boxing titles (SA and WBC Youth), I want him to excel at school because education is key in life. I am playing a father figure to most of my fighters."I guide them the same way I do my own flesh and blood."The bout on Friday night - scheduled for 12 rounds - was staged by Fuzile's promoter Thembalethu Ntuthu who trades under the banner of Rumble Africa Promotion."I am happy that we managed to juggle time between his studies and preparations for the WBC Youth belt so that he achieves good results from both boxing and school," said Njekanye.Fuzile, 20, was in Grade 11 this year at Kusile Comprehensive High School in Duncan Village. He is waiting for results."I know that he will bring positive results," said Njekanye who has guided Fuzile to three knockouts in six wins.Before turning professional late in December 2014, Fuzile won the SA amateur title three times in the juniors, a gold medal in the 2014 All Africa Champions in Botswana. He also represented SA in the World Youth Championship in Bulgaria and Germany in 2014."If I could have it my way, Azinga would be back in action early next year. His fight on Friday lasted for only a minute."
