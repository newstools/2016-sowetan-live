Cape Town City's fairytale 2016 was capped off with their maiden cup final win, seeing off a game but outmatched SuperSport United 2-1 in the Telkom Knockout Cup final at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. City's songbird on the left, Aubrey Ngoma, was pivotal to the win. He scored the first in the 13th minute and provided the assist for Judas Moseamedi's 73rd goal. That proved to be winner as SuperSport had no response other than Kingston Nkatha's 71st minute equaliser. While SuperSport had their chances, the stars aligned for Eric Tinkler's side and they made the most of the opportunities that came their way.SuperSport were denied an opportunity to win their second cup final of the year after beating Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup final at the same stadium.City's statement of intent was made when Ngoma's left-footed shot had the beating of Reyaad Pieterse.Onismor Bhasera's careless pass to Thuso Phala saw the right-winger being bundled off the ball. Manyama was the recipient of the ball and his pass found the marauding Ngoma.City had chances to finish the game in the game in the 30th and 44th minutes but Sibusiso Masina and Bhongolethu Jayiya found different ways of not scoring. The former was thwarted by Pieterse's after Clayton Daniels inexplicable lost sight of Ngoma's cross while the latter should have done better with his header.The game was at its most frenetic in the first 20 minutes of the second half as chances came and went.SuperSport equalised when Morgan Gould and Daniels conspired to direct the ball to Nkhatha's feet, who converted from close range.Whatever fight SuperSport had died two minutes later when Moseamedi's deflected Ngoma's cross past Shuaib Walters. It was a fortuitously scored goal, but the type that wins cup finals when the requisite luck that is created is used perfectly. It all fell into place for City.
