All over the world, tender systems or procurement processes are avenues through which state corruption and state capture take place. For this reason, as the Gauteng provincial government, we have established the open tender process to fight corruption in procurement processes.The open tender process is the provincial government's innovation which is being implemented by all departments to improve transparency in government procurement processes.The process is also aimed at building public confidence in a government procurement system which has been tainted by allegedly corrupt activities.When the system was first introduced by the ANC-led fifth provincial administration after the 2014 elections, there was some resistance and lobbying from some civil servants and businesses who argued that it may lead to the exclusion of black companies from benefiting from public procurement policy. Members of the executive council fully supported the opening up of public procurement for public scrutiny and probity.The open tender process was piloted in the Department of Roads and Transport and Treasury's banking tender. The open tender system has since been expanded to all departments in the province with the full support of the executive council.Currently, 72 projects worth R10-billion have been awarded using the open tender system.In the 2015/16 financial year, we spent around R25-billion on goods and services under the open tender system, of which R19-billion, or 77%, went to black-owned companies, 20% to companies owned by women and 9.3% to youth-owned companies. This dispels widespread concerns that the open tender process will only empower those already empowered and reinforce the marginalisation of those historically excluded from the mainstream of the economy.In October this year, we hosted the Open Tender Seminar where business and civil society expressed overwhelming support for the open tender process. In this regard, we are proud that Gauteng is the leader in promoting open government principles. This approach has received public commendation from civil society, business and government leaders.We have been urging all municipalities in the province to follow suit. I have emphasised that black economic empowerment is a constitutional imperative that must be implemented openly and transparently through, among other measures, the open tender system.An open tender system is one of the most powerful instruments for promoting clean governance and fighting corruption. It has practically demonstrated how public confidence in the procurement process can be restored.The provincial government remains strong in its determination to win the war on corruption and promote impeccable integrity, transparency and accountability in all the decision-making processes of government.The ANC-led provincial government is very proud of its focused and single-minded determination to fight corruption and restore public confidence.The entire provincial cabinet and ANC provincial executive committee are of one mind in how important the fight against corruption is. The open tender process is a ground-breaking initiative of the fifth administration in Gauteng. It is not a theory, it is not a plan; it is something we have put into action.As result, in the 2017/18 financial year, the executive council will table a bill to ensure that the open tender system becomes an act of the provincial parliament. The move is in line with broader ambitions to safeguard the public purse, combat corruption and restore public confidence in Gauteng's public procurement system.The system aims to promote transparency in government and greater accountability to citizens.The political will and determination to win the war against corruption cannot be measured in the words we utter. It must be demonstrated in the practical and preventive measures we put in place to promote clean governance, integrity and enhance public scrutiny and probity.Any fears raised by business people about whether the open tender system will hinder black economic empowerment have been allayed. There is no turning back.Makhura is premier of Gauteng
