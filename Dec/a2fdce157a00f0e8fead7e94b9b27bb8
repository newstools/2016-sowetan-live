National First Division strugglers Santos have parted ways with coach Zeca Marques after a run of poor results left them struggling at the foot of the table.Santos a top Premier Soccer League side in the early 2000s are second from the bottom with no wins in their last 14 games in all competitions. I have decided to step down as head coach of Santos Marques said on Monday. This is a joint decision made together with the chairman of the club Goolam Allie. We have decided to part ways in the best interests of the club. Notwithstanding my best efforts unfortunately results have just not gone our way."It is the correct time to give an opportunity to another coach to run the club. Marques who led Moroka Swallows to the MTN8 title in 2012 had initially resigned at the end of last season but was persuaded by Allie to remain for this campaign.Santos were league champions under Gordon Igesund in the 2001/02 season and also claimed the Bob Save Super Bowl (2001) BP Top 8 (2002) and Absa Cup (2003) in a golden era for the Cape Town team.They were relegated from the top flight at the end of the 2011/12 season and never been able to win their top-flight status back. - TMG Digital
