Brilliant Khuzwayo has insisted that there is nothing wrong with Kaizer Chiefs despite Amakhosi having gone eight games without a win.The goalkeeper maintains that only luck has eluded Chiefs. He has assured supporters that the players were doing everything in their power to get back to winning ways."We can see that things are not going well, but as a team we are positive and trying to lift each other," said Khuzwayo, who was in goals in Chiefs' 3-1 loss to Chippa United just over a week ago."We are trying all the time to push and I think we just don't have the luck," he said.Chiefs will need to be at their best against Bloemfontein Celtic in another Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium tonight (7.30pm).The goalie said Celtic deserved some respect and rightly so because Phunya Sele Sele were showing some improvements, having gone four matches unbeaten since co-coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka took over on a caretaker basis."Every team in the PSL needs to be respected and we do respect Celtic, but all we want from them are the three points," he said.Khuzwayo, however, may be relegated to the bench after Itumeleng Khune returned to training this week.Khune missed the match against Chippa due to a knock he sustained in the 1-1 draw against Cape Town City a fortnight ago.Winger William Twala also returned to training after he recovered from an ankle injury that kept him out for the last four matches, but defenders Enocent Mkhabela and Erick Mathoho are still struggling with an abdominal muscle tear and groin strain, respectively.Midfielder Willard Katsande and Sibusiso Khumalo will miss the match because of suspension.Celtic, who have not beaten Chiefs in the league since 2009, have no suspension worries and are at full strength.
