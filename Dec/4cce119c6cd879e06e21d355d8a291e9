The South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) has been ordered to remove its Group Executive for Corporate Affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng from its employ.The Western Cape High Court ruled on Monday that Motsoeneng's new appointment was unlawful and irrational, reported eNCA.The court ruled that Motsoeneng cannot occupy any position at the public broadcaster until the recommendations of the Public Protector are set aside or disciplinary process against him are concluded.The DA had brought the application to have his appointment declared invalid in October arguing that Motsoeneng is unfit to hold any executive position at the SABC .This followed the dismissal of his appeals against court rulings that upheld the findings of a Public Protector s report that found his appointment as chief operating officer was irregular.Motsoeneng was subsequent to that ruling appointed to head up corporate affairs.The high court ruling came as Parliament s ad hoc committee continues with its inquiry into issues at the SABC and the board s fitness to hold office.Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane excitedly shared the verdict tweeting: Hlaudi is unemployed @sabc new D.C. must be instituted .This was confirmed by the Right to Know movement which tweeted WC High Court rules Hlaudi s appointment unlawful &amp; irrational should not hold any position at SABC .Calling the ruling a victory for the rule of law and constitutionalism Maimane also shared that Motsoeneng must pay the legal fees in his personal capacity.
