President Jacob Zuma s first appearance in parliament since the courts made two damning rulings against him got off to a bumpy start on Wednesday.The EFF wrote a letter to speaker Baleka Mbete asking that he not be allowed to speak in the National Assembly as he had violated the Constitution.Zuma was present to address the National Assembly in Cape Town regarding the 2016/17 budget allocations for his administration.Mbete declined the request.In the first court ruling the Constitutional Court found that Zuma had failed to uphold respect and defend the Constitution.EFF leader Julius Malema vowed after the ruling that Zuma would not be allowed to address parliament.The second court ruling by the North Gauteng High Court found the National Prosecuting Authority was wrong to drop fraud corruption and racketeering charges against him relating to the arms deal.EFF members shouted You have broken an oath of office. You are an embarrassment Baleka even to your party. Switch off the mics somebody urged the speaker.Parliamentary protection officers were summoned to which EFF members said: We are going to throw water in your face. Floyd Shivambu said it was against the law to allow an illegitimate person to address the house.The DA suggested that Zuma be allowed to speak so that he could apologise for violating the Constitution.The entire spectacle was watched by an Egyptian parliamentary delegation visiting the house.
